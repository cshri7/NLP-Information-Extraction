0,APT3,"APT3 Hackers Linked to Chinese Ministry of State Security

Independent researchers and experts from threat intelligence firm Recorded Future are confident that the cyber espionage group tracked as APT3 is directly linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).
While much of the security community typically tries to avoid making attribution statements, arguing that false flags make this task difficult, there are some individuals and companies that don’t shy away from accusing governments of conducting sophisticated cyberattacks.
A mysterious group called “intrusiontruth,” which claims to focus on investigating some of the most important advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, has recently published a series of blog posts on APT3, a group that is also known as UPS Team, Gothic Panda, Buckeye and TG-0110.
The cyberspies, believed to be sponsored by China, have been active since at least 2009, targeting many organizations in the United States and elsewhere via spear-phishing, zero-day exploits, and various other tools and techniques. Researchers noticed last year that APT3 had shifted its attention from the U.S. and the U.K. to Hong Kong, where it had mainly targeted political entities using a backdoor dubbed “Pirpi.”
Intrusiontruth has conducted an analysis of APT3’s command and control (C&C) infrastructure, particularly domain registration data. Their research led to two individuals, named Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao, who apparently registered many of the domains used by the threat actor.
Both these individuals are listed as shareholders for a China-based security firm called the Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, or Boyusec. In November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon learned from Pentagon intelligence officials that this company had been working with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to develop spyware-laden security products that would be loaded onto computers and phones. The unnamed officials said Boyusec was “closely connected” to the Chinese Ministry of State Security.
Intrusiontruth concluded that either Boyusec has two shareholders with the same name as members of APT3, or Boyusec is in fact APT3, which is the more likely scenario.
Recorded Future has dug deeper to find more evidence connecting APT3 to China’s MSS. In a report published on Wednesday, the company said it had attributed the group directly to the MSS with “a high degree of confidence.”
Researchers pointed out that in addition to Huawei, which claimed to use Boyusec for security evaluations of its corporate intranet, Boyusec was also a partner of the Guangdong Information Technology Security Evaluation Center (Guangdong ITSEC), and the organizations have been collaborating on an active defense lab since 2014.
Guangdong ITSEC is apparently a subordinate of the China Information Technology Evaluation Center (CNITSEC), which, according to academic research, is run by the Ministry of State Security.
Experts believe many of the ministry’s subordinates, particularly ones at provincial and local levels, have legitimate public missions and act as a cover-up for intelligence operations.
“Companies in sectors that have been victimized by APT3 now must adjust their strategies to defend against the resources and technology of the Chinese government. In this real-life David vs. Goliath situation, customers need both smart security controls and policy, as well as actionable and strategic threat intelligence,” Recorded Future said in its report.

1,APT3,"China-Linked APT3 Group Focuses Attacks on Hong Kong

A China-linked cyberespionage group has shifted its attention from the United States to Hong Kong, where it has targeted more than a dozen organizations over the past year.
FireEye reported last week that APT3, a threat actor believed to be sponsored by China, had targeted two Hong Kong government agencies in early August. The attackers had used spear-phishing emails to trick recipients into installing what the security firm said was a previously unseen piece of malware.
APT3, also known as UPS Team, Gothic Panda, Buckeye and TG-0110, has been active since at least 2009. The group’s attacks often involved zero-day vulnerabilities and flaws that had just been patched.
Many of the group’s earlier attacks focused on the United States, including government organizations. However, Symantec, which tracks the threat actor as Buckeye, noticed last year that the hackers had become increasingly interested in Hong Kong.
Symantec observed roughly 82 APT3 victims since the beginning of 2015, but experts pointed out that the group had cast a wide net and only 17 of these organizations were persistently targeted. The list of victims included 13 organizations in Hong Kong, three in the U.S. and one in the U.K.
While there were some periods last year when all three countries had been targeted, researchers noticed that the U.K. and the U.S. were no longer attacked starting with March 2016.
In the recent attacks observed by Symantec, mostly aimed at political entities in Hong Kong, APT3 used ZIP archives and Windows shortcut (.lnk) files to deliver a backdoor dubbed by the security firm Pirpi.
The infection method appears to be the same in the attacks observed by FireEye – a ZIP archive contains a shortcut file that downloads malware. However, the early August attacks spotted by FireEye did not leverage Pirpi, which has been around since 2010 and which the company tracks as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter. Instead, the security firm said they involved a new malware tool.
This suggests that China may have stepped up its attacks just before the Hong Kong legislative elections that took place on September 4. The Chinese government has been increasingly concerned about Hong Kong’s push for more political independence.
In addition to Pirpi, Symantec observed APT3 using various other tools, including keyloggers, remote command execution tools, system information harvesting tools, and browser password stealers. Researchers said the group appears to be focusing on file and print servers, which suggests they are mainly interested in stealing documents.",https://www.securityweek.com/china-linked-apt3-group-focuses-attacks-hong-kong
2,APT3,"APT3 Group Using Windows OLE Vulnerability: FireEye

The attack group known as APT3 is now using exploits for recently-patched Windows vulnerabilities, according to a report from FireEye.

APT3 is believed to be behind 'Operation Clandestine Fox', a campaign first disclosed in April when the group began using a zero-day in Internet Explorer in targeted attacks. In May, the attackers began specifically targeting Windows XP machines running Internet Explorer 8. The group has also been seen using social networks to fool targets into installing malware.

""APT3…the actors responsible for Operation Clandestine Fox has quietly continued to send waves of spearphishing messages over the past few months,"" FireEye researchers blogged. ""This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.""

""The use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors, both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits,"" the researchers continued. ""Further, the use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is historically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.""

CVE-2014-6332 was fixed earlier this month during Patch Tuesday. The bug garnered significant attention because it had exploitable for nearly two decades. The vulnerability affected all versions of Windows from Windows 95 on, and has been remotely exploitable since Internet Explorer 3.0.
CVE-2014-4113 meanwhile exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who exploited it could potentially run arbitrary code in kernel mode.

""Although APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity has demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering,"" the FireEye researchers wrote. ""Since Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that did not rely on zero-day exploits. The combination of this sustained operational tempo and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day exploit code.""
""No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully,"" the researchers added.",https://www.securityweek.com/apt3-group-using-windows-ole-vulnerability-fireeye
3,APT3,"Flash Player Flaw Used by APT3 Group Added to Magnitude Exploit Kit

An exploit for a Flash Player vulnerability patched by Adobe last week with the release of version 18.0.0.194 has been integrated into the Magnitude exploit kit.
The existence of the heap buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113) that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution was brought to light by FireEye. The security firm discovered that the flaw has been leveraged by the China-based attack group known as APT3 (UPS) in a large-scale phishing campaign aimed at organizations in the aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, telecommunications, high-tech, and transportation industries.
The security hole, which according to Trend Micro is similar to a previously discovered bug (CVE-2015-3043), exists due to the way Adobe Flash Player parses Flash Video (FLV) files.
Four days after Adobe patched the vulnerability, the French security researcher “Kafeine” noticed that an exploit for the bug had been included in the Magnitude exploit kit. The expert reported on Sunday that cybercriminals have been using the exploit to deliver the Cryptowall ransomware.
Jérôme Segura, senior security researcher at Malwarebytes, believes the exploit for CVE-2015-3113 will be added to other kits “very soon.” However, Kafeine told SecurityWeek that he had not seen the exploit in any other kits as of June 29, 4:00 AM EST.
It’s not uncommon for cybercriminals to start exploiting Flash Player vulnerabilities in their operations shortly after they are patched by Adobe. In late May, an exploit for a Flash Player bug fixed by Adobe on May 11 was added to the Angler exploit kit. A few days later, experts noticed that exploits for the same bug had been added to the Magnitude, Neutrino, and Nuclear Pack kits.
Experts told SecurityWeek that in many cases malicious actors develop these exploits by reverse engineering the patches. In the case of zero-day flaws, the exploit kit teams either have skilled members who develop the exploits themselves, or they have the funds to acquire them from the black market, said malware analyst Yonathan Klijnsma.
The authors of different exploit kits are usually in direct competition so they don’t share exploits. However, it’s not uncommon for them to reverse engineer the exploits created by other teams.
“Once a new exploit has been introduced in one kit, it’s pretty easy for others to copy it,” Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure, told SecurityWeek earlier this month. “Some criminals might be behind several exploit kits, just like Paunch was behind Blackhole and Cool, and they may use the same exploit in all their kits.”",https://www.securityweek.com/flash-player-flaw-used-apt3-group-added-magnitude-exploit-kit
4,APT3,"U.S. Indicts Chinese For Hacking Siemens, Moody’s

U.S. authorities filed charges Monday against three China-based hackers for stealing sensitive information from U.S. based companies, including data from Siemens industrial groups and accessing a high-profile email account at Moody’s. 
Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao and Xia Lei, who the Department of Justice (DOJ) says are Chinese nationals and residents of China, were indicted by a grand jury for a series of cyber-attacks against three corporate victims in the financial, engineering and technology industries between 2011 and May 2017.  
Victims named in the indictment include Moody’s Analytics, Siemens, and GPS technology firm Trimble.
According to the FBI, the hackers work for Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited, a firm that purports to be a China-based Internet security firm also known as “Boyusec.”
Tracked as APT3 by FireEye, and Gothic Panda by CrowdStrike, the group is also known as UPS Team, Buckeye and TG-0110, and has previously been linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).
“We’ve tracked their activity back to 2007 and they are one of the most technically advanced state-affiliated actors in China,” Adam Meyers, VP of Intelligence at CrowdStrike, told SecurityWeek. “Their previous targeting includes industries such as Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Technology, NGOs, etc., that are primarily aligned with China’s economic objectives.”
In November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon learned from Pentagon intelligence officials that Boyusec had been working with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to develop spyware-laden security products that would be loaded onto computers and phones. The unnamed officials said Boyusec was “closely connected” to the Chinese Ministry of State Security.
According to the indictment, the hackers:
• Stole approximately 407 gigabytes of proprietary commercial data pertaining to Siemens’s energy, technology and transportation businesses.
• Accessed the internal email server of Moody’s Analytics and placed a forwarding rule in the email account of a prominent employee, and set it to forward all emails to and from the account to web-based email accounts controlled by the attackers.
• Stole at least 275 megabytes of data, including compressed data, which included hundreds of files that would have assisted a Trimble competitor in developing, providing and marketing a similar product without incurring millions of dollars in research and development costs.
“The primary goal of the co-conspirators’ unauthorized access to victim computers was to search for, identify, copy, package, and steal data from those computers, including confidential business and commercial information, work product, and sensitive victim employee information, such as usernames and passwords that could be used to extend unauthorized access within the victim systems,” the DOJ said.  “For the three victim entities listed in the Indictment, such information included hundreds of gigabytes of data regarding the housing finance, energy, technology, transportation, construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors.”
Intrusion Truth previously conducted an analysis of APT3’s command and control (C&C) infrastructure, and analyzed domain registration data. Their research led to two individuals, named Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao, who apparently registered many of the domains used by the threat actor.
Researchers noticed last year that the group had shifted its attention from the U.S. and the U.K. to Hong Kong, where it had mainly targeted political entities using a backdoor dubbed “Pirpi.” 
CrowdStrike has seen an uptick in activity by the group since 2016, Meyers said.
In addition to Pirpi, Symantec observed APT3 using various other tools, including keyloggers, remote command execution tools, system information harvesting tools, and browser password stealers. Researchers said the group appears to be focusing on file and print servers, which suggests they are mainly interested in stealing documents to support their espionage efforts.
“Defendants Wu, Dong and Xia launched coordinated and targeted cyber intrusions against businesses operating in the United States, including here in the Western District of Pennsylvania, in order to steal confidential business information,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Song. “These conspirators masked their criminal conspiracy by exploiting unwitting computers, called ‘hop points,’ conducting ‘spearphish’ email campaigns to gain unauthorized access to corporate computers, and deploying malicious code to infiltrate the victim computer networks.”",https://www.securityweek.com/us-indicts-chinese-hacking-siemens-moody
5,APT3,"Adobe Flash Player Zero-Day Exploited in Attack Campaign

Adobe Systems released an emergency update today to address a security vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that is being exploited in a large-scale phishing campaign.
The bug, CVE-2015-3113, is a heap buffer overflow issue. It was discovered by researchers at FireEye, who have linked it to attacks by the hacking crew APT3 that have targeted a number of industries, including the telecommunications, transportation and aerospace and defense sectors.
""Adobe is aware of reports that CVE-2015-3113 is being actively exploited in the wild via limited, targeted attacks,"" Adobe stated in its advisory. ""Systems running Internet Explorer for Windows 7 and below, as well as Firefox on Windows XP, are known targets.""
According to FireEye, the attackers' emails contained links to compromised web servers that served either benign content or a malicious Adobe Flash Player file exploiting the bug.
""Upon clicking the URLs provided in the phishing emails, targets were redirected to a compromised server hosting JavaScript profiling scripts,"" FireEye researchers blogged. ""Once a target host was profiled, victims downloaded a malicious Adobe Flash Player SWF file and an FLV file, detailed below. This ultimately resulted in a custom backdoor known as SHOTPUT, detected by FireEye as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter, being delivered to the victim’s system.""
""The attack exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the way Adobe Flash Player parses Flash Video (FLV) files,"" the researchers explained. ""The exploit uses common vector corruption techniques to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and uses Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP). A neat trick to their ROP technique makes it simpler to exploit and will evade some ROP detection techniques. Shellcode is stored in the packed Adobe Flash Player exploit file alongside a key used for its decryption. The payload is xor encoded and hidden inside an image.""
APT3 has been linked to the use of browser-based zero-days in the past, and will typically dump credentials and move laterally across a compromised network to hit additional victims, the FireEye researchers added.
""Now that the exploit has been discovered, most security and operations teams are scrambling to do one of two things – race to deploy the newest patch before hackers can leverage the exploit for an attack,"" said Clinton Karr, senior security strategist at Bromium. ""Or test the patch to make sure it integrates with legacy systems. This latest zero-day and others before it could have been isolated in the first place. Only by isolating the threat are security and ops teams granted the grace period needed to test and deploy these critical patches.""
""The vulnerability lies in the video decoding part of Flash and the exploit shows some signs of sophistication by introducing new techniques in their use of ROP,"" blogged Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek. ""Patch as quickly as possible. 0-days once discovered this way tend to spread quickly to other cyber criminal groups. Adobe mentions that all known targets seem to use Windows 7 and Internet Explorer and Firefox on Windows XP, but we don't recommend holding back on patching even if you are running other configurations (hopefully not XP, though). Users of IE10/11 and Google Chrome will get their patches through their browsers directly, everybody else will need to download directly from Adobe.""",https://www.securityweek.com/adobe-flash-player-zero-day-exploited-attack-campaign
6,APT3,"State-Sponsored Attackers Use Web Analytics for Reconnaissance

A threat group believed to be sponsored by a nation state has compromised over 100 websites in an effort to track and profile potential targets, FireEye reported on Monday.
The reconnaissance campaign, which FireEye has been tracking since last year, is similar and possibly related to the activities of the Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group identified as Waterbug (Symantec) and Turla (Kaspersky Lab). The actor is mainly known for its operations involving malware toolkits such as Turla (Snake/Uroburos) and Epic Turla (Wipbot/Tavdig).
Web analytics allows advertisers and other organizations to measure web traffic and determine the most efficient ways of reaching the targeted audience. However, the same tools and techniques can also be leveraged by malicious actors.
According to FireEye, attackers have used web analytics and open source tools to collect data about potential victims and their devices, information they can use to track and profile targets and possibly infect them with malware.
The group monitored by the security firm has hijacked more than 100 carefully selected websites in what is referred to as a strategic web compromise. On these websites, the malicious hackers injected a small piece of code that silently redirects visitors to a second compromised website that hosts a profiling script.
The script, dubbed by FireEye “WITCHCOVEN,” collects the victim’s computer and browser configuration and deploys a persistent tracking cookie, also known as a “supercookie,” on their device.
“We believe the actors analyze the collected data to identify unique users and pair them with information about their computer to later deploy exploits tailored to their particular software and computer configuration,” FireEye said in its report.
For example, if the attackers determine that the targeted user is running outdated software that is known to contain serious vulnerabilities, they can easily hack their machine using available exploits, without the need to expose zero-days. Zero-day exploits are likely used only against a limited number of victims whose computers are fully patched, FireEye explained.
FireEye says this tactic has been used in targeted operations by other APT groups, including the Chinese actor APT3 in Operation Clandestine Wolf, and the Russian group APT28 in Operation Russian Doll.
The data collected by the threat group observed by FireEye can also be useful for creating well-crafted spear phishing emails, for building a user profile that can be leveraged for traditional espionage, and creating a database of potential targets, the security firm said.
FireEye has determined that the more than 100 compromised websites are likely to be visited by people interested in international travel, diplomacy, international economics, energy production and policy, and government matters. The list of targets includes government, embassy, higher education and research, entertainment and culture, NGO, international law, media, consumer goods and retail, energy, construction and engineering, visa services, and high tech websites in tens of countries across the world.
Of particular interest appear to be executives, military personnel, government officials, and diplomats from Europe and the United States.
FireEye customers in sectors such as education, government, financial services, energy and utilities, legal, healthcare, entertainment, media, hospitality, manufacturing, services and consulting, and high tech have reported seeing WITCHCOVEN infections.
The security firm believes the reconnaissance campaign is sponsored by a nation state based on the profile of the targeted entities, the scale of the activity and the scope of the operation, and the lack of obvious exploit or malware delivery, which indicates that the attackers want to limit exposure of their tools most likely because they are running a long-term operation with specific intelligence requirements.

7,APT3,"New Adobe Flash Player Flaw Shares Similarities With Previous Vulnerability: Trend Micro

Researchers at Trend Micro say the zero-day vulnerability patched Tuesday by Adobe Systems has a similar underlying cause as an older flaw.
On Tuesday, Adobe patched CVE-2015-3113 - a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player being exploited in the wild by the attack group APT3.
""Our analysis of the current flaw reveals that the root cause of CVE-2015-3113 is similar to CVE-2015-3043,"" blogged Trend Micro Threats Analyst Peter Pi. ""Both cause a buffer overflow within the Flash Player code. In fact, code targeting the previous exploit can also cause crashes in version 18.0.0.160 (the version immediately before this emergency update).""
Both vulnerabilities can be used to run arbitrary code on targeted systems if they visit a site with a malicious Flash file. Both are also heap overflow vulnerabilities in the FLV audio parsing flow, reside in how Flash Player processes audio with the Nellymoser codec and can be triggered by modifying the FLV file’s audio tag, explained Pi.
""They both overflow a hardcoded length heap buffer with a length of 0x2000,"" he wrote. ""CVE-2015-3043 and CVE-2015-3113 both trigger this bug using sample_count * sample_size > 0x2000, and bypass the length check.""
Adobe patched CVE-2015-3043 in 17.0.0.169 by limiting the sample count acquired from the FLV audio tag. In version 18.0.0.160, the code underwent significant changes, Pi noted.
""The GetSampleCount function checks the final buffer size needed,"" he explained. ""If the final buffer size is larger than 0x2000, it will limit it to 0x2000. However, this ignores the Nellymoser decode function’s hardcoded double operation; this can be used to trigger a heap buffer overflow once again.""
According to Pi, both vulnerabilities ""share the same underlying root cause.""
""This incident highlights how important careful development of patches is, to prevent patched bugs from being re-exploited at a later time,"" Pi wrote. ""Regression testing must also be a part of software development in order to check that old bugs do not threaten new versions of software.""
In a statement to SecurityWeek, Adobe said it performs regression testing as part of its standard testing process.
""As the Trend Micro article notes, CVE-2015-3113 and CVE-2015-3043 are similar, but different,"" according to the company. ""We will be performing a 0-day review on this issue to determine whether the regression test did not consistently reproduce the issue or whether there is another reason the similarity was not immediately noted and addressed.""",https://www.securityweek.com/new-adobe-flash-player-flaw-shares-similarities-previous-vulnerability-trend-micro
