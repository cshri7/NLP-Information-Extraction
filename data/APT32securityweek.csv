0,APT32,"APT32: Vietnamese Hackers Target Foreign Corporations

APT32 is the ""newest named advanced persistent threat group,"" according to a new report from FireEye. Published yesterday, the report shows it to be a sophisticated and well-resourced cyber espionage actor targeting Vietnamese interests around the globe -- and although not-previously classified in the APTn schema, it has been operating since at least 2013. The APT designation was also commenced back in 2013, when Mandiant used it to describe the first hacking group, APT1, that it was willing to call 'state-sponsored'.
FireEye's analysis stops short of defining APT32 as another state-sponsored hacking group; but that is the clear suspicion. ""APT32,"" writes Nick Carr, senior manager of FireEye's Mandiant Incident Response team, ""leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests.""
He subsequently told Reuters it was impossible to identify or locate the hackers precisely or confirm they were working for the Vietnamese government but the information they sought would be of very little use to any other party. He also said that in some cases the intrusions seemed to be assessing the victims' adherence to national regulations.
The Vietnamese government denies this. ""The government of Vietnam does not allow any form of cyber-attacks against organizations or individuals,"" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang. ""All cyber-attacks or threats to cybersecurity, must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and laws.""
The APT32 targets include a European corporation that was about to construct a manufacturing facility in Vietnam in 2014; numerous Vietnamese and foreign corporations in 2016; a hospitality developer planning to expand operations in Vietnam in 2016; and the Vietnamese offices of a global consulting firm in 2017. In all cases, espionage would give the Vietnam government either a commercial advantage in discussions, or greater understanding of foreign companies within the country.
Other attacks, however, have been targeted at individuals outside of Vietnam -- more specifically governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam diaspora who, warns Carr, ""may continue to be targeted.""
FireEye's isolation of APT32 followed its investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam. These investigations provided ""sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye's newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32.""
FireEye's analysis of APT32's current campaign depicts a well-resourced and innovative attacker. It uses phishing emails containing a weaponized attachment. Unusually, the attachment is not a Word document but an ActiveMime (an undocumented Microsoft format) file. This file contains an OLE file containing malicious macros.
The attacker also used a novel approach to track the success of its phishing emails, using legitimate cloud-based email analytics. The phishing attachment can contain HTML image tags. ""When a document with this feature is opened,"" writes Carr, ""Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist. Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms.""
If the macros are successfully loaded, they create two scheduled tasks to act as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors. The first launches Squiblydoo, an application whitelisting script protection bypass, to enable the download of a backdoor from APT's infrastructure. The second leads to a secondary backdoor delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script configured to communicate with the domains blog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and yii.yiihao126[.]net.
APT32's persistence and obfuscation goes further. ""Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access, APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon's Invoke-Obfuscation framework,"" notes the analysis.
It is APT32's use of a custom suite of backdoors that has helped FireEye tie different campaigns to this one particular group. That suite includes Windshield, Komprogo, Soundbite, Phoreal, and Beacon. ""FireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests,"" writes Carr. He warns that APT32 demonstrates that state-sponsored cyber espionage is no longer necessarily limited to the few known actors: China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea.
""As more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets.""",https://www.securityweek.com/apt32-vietnamese-hackers-target-foreign-corporations
1,APT32,"How APT32 Hacked a Global Asian Firm With Persistence

In a cyber intrusion dubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty, the OceanLotus hacking group -- otherwise known as APT32 -- played cat-and-mouse with a security firm that was tracking its every move.
Cybereason (a Boston, Mass.-based provider of threat detection solutions) had been employed by a large global firm operating in Asia that suspected, but could not locate, a breach. The investigators found evidence of an ongoing intrusion by advanced hackers it recognized as the OceanLotus Group. Earlier this month, FireEye all but declared the group -- designated by FireEye as APT32 - to be a Vietnamese nation-state actor. 
Cybereason's investigation showed that this group had been inside the Asian firm for more than a year before it was discovered. Furthermore, the attacker took ongoing evasive action to retain its presence even though it almost certainly knew it had been detected.
During the investigation, Cybereason found more than 70 payloads and numerous domains. It discovered six custom-built tools that it considers to be the OceanLotus Group's signature tools. FireEye's report noted five such tools; but Cybereason also detected Backdoor.Win32.Denis, first described by Kaspersky just last month, which it now adds to the OceanLotus armory. Win32.Denis uses DNS tunneling for C&C communications.
Cybereason was able to uncover the entire lifecycle of the Cobalt Kitty operation. The attack started with targeted spear-phishing emails: one with a link to a fake Flash installer and another with an attached weaponized Office document. The Word document contained a malicious macro that creates persistence on the compromised machine using two scheduled tasks. In both cases, the end purpose was to download secondary payloads including Cobalt Strike Beacon.
The process is 'fileless'. Persistence is maintained through the Windows registry, services and scheduled tasks. A PowerShell script is used to fetch Cobalt Strike Beacon, which also operates in memory.
Cybereason reported its discoveries to the client, who then used both Windows Group Policy Object (GPO) and Cybereason's execution prevention feature that prevents PowerShell execution. But the attacker didn't give up -- the group adapted, initially concentrating on its own custom and stealthy backdoors. It then resumed the PowerShell operation. ""The attackers used a modified version of a publicly available tool called PSUnlock to bypass the PowerShell execution restrictions,"" notes the report.
Cybereason suspects that the group were ready and prepared for this scenario. ""The attackers' remarkable ability to quickly adapt,"" suggests Cybereason, ""demonstrates their skill and familiarity with and command of the company's internal network and its operations."" 
The attacker also used DLL hijacking leveraging Windows Search, Google Update and Kaspersky's Avpia to load fake DLLs containing malicious code. It used DNS tunneling for C2 communication and data exfiltration. ""To ensure that the DNS traffic will not be filtered,"" reports Cybereason, ""the attackers configured the backdoor to communicate with Google and OpenDNS DNS servers, since most organizations and security products will not filter traffic to those two major DNS services.""
It also employed an innovative additional and difficult-to-detect C2 channel by installing a backdoor macro in Outlook. It was able to execute commands, deploy tools and steal data via email. The macro looks for incoming commands, deletes the relevant email, executes the discovered commands from the deleted items folder, and finally deletes all evidence of the emails sent or received from the attackers.
""This backdoor has not been publicly documented,"" says Cybereason, ""and is one of the most unique TTPs with regards to the threat actor. Outlook backdoors are not a new concept and have been observed in different APTs in the past. However, this specific type of Outlook backdoor can be considered as one of the 'signature tools' of the OceanLotus Group.""
Similar to the methodology attributed by FireEye to APT32, the group combined its custom backdoors with freely available tools; for example, using Mimikatz as the primary tool to obtain credentials and aid lateral movement.
Throughout the operation, the OceanLotus Group showed a preference for using and adapting such publicly available tools. ""However, the attackers should not be considered script-kiddies,"" says the report. ""Most of the publicly available tools were either obfuscated, modified and even merged with other tools to evade antivirus detection. This type of customization requires good coding skills and understanding of how those tools work.""
Cybereason does not go as far as FireEye in suggesting that OceanLotus may be state-sponsored, but it describes the group as ""determined and motivated... they never gave up, even when part of their attack infrastructure was exposed and shut down by the defenders."" It doesn't name the victim firm, nor does it specifically tie the intrusion to Vietnamese interests. All that Cybereason would tell SecurityWeek is, ""We can only specify that the attackers are targeting a global corporation in Asia.""
Nevertheless, a wider analysis of OceanLotus suggests that ""Most of the samples caught in-the-wild seem to target Vietnamese speakers. Some of the samples exhibit clear evidence of targeting Vietnamese entities.""
As for the group itself, Operation Cobalt Kitty outlines attackers with ""a remarkable ability to quickly adapt, introduce new tools and fine tune existing ones to bypass security solutions and avoid detection. The high number of payloads and the elaborate C2 infrastructure used in this attack can be indicative of the resources that the attackers had at their disposal. Simultaneously orchestrating multiple APT campaigns of such magnitude and sophistication takes time, financial resources and a large team who can support it.""
Cybereason closed a $25 million Series B funding round in May 2015, and quickly followed that with a $59 million Series C funding round in October 2015. Overall, the company has raised more than $88 million in funding.",https://www.securityweek.com/how-apt32-hacked-global-asian-firm-persistence
2,APT32,"""OceanLotus"" Spies Use New Backdoor in Recent Attacks

OceanLotus, a cyber-espionage group believed to be operating out of Vietnam, has been using a new backdoor in recently observed attacks, but also using previously established tactics, ESET reveals.
Also known as APT32 and APT-C-00, the advanced persistent threat (APT) has been targeting high-profile corporate and government organizations in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. The group is well-resourced and determined and is known to be using custom-built malware in combination with techniques long known to be successful.
One of the latest malware families used by the group is a fully-fledged backdoor that provides operators with remote access to compromised machines, along with the ability to manipulate files, registries, and processes, as well as the option to load additional components if needed.
For distribution purposes, OceanLotus uses a two-stage attack that employs a dropper to gain initial foothold on the targeted system and prepare the stage for the backdoor, ESET explains in a new report (PDF).
Spear-phishing emails are used to lure victims into opening an attachment that uses a fake icon to load password-protected decoy document while the malicious dropper is executed in the background.
Fake installers posing as updates for popular applications are also used, as part of watering hole attacks, where websites that the victims are likely to visit are compromised.
The dropper package includes components executed in a number of stages involving heavy code obfuscation to prevent detection. The malware authors also included garbage code in the dropper, for similar purposes.
To achieve persistence, the dropper creates a Windows service if administrator privileges are available, or modifies the operating system’s registry if executed with normal privileges. Code designed to delete the lure document is also dropped onto the system.
A digitally-signed Symantec executable (rastlsc.exe) is also dropped, along with a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named rastls.dll (detected as Win32/Salgorea.BD). The signed executable loads the malicious DLL, which makes the malicious behavior look legitimate, a technique (called DLL side-loading) that has been abused before.
The backdoor supports over 23 commands to: fingerprint the system; read a file or registry key; create a process; create a file, a registry entry or a stream in memory; write to or query the registry; search for files on the system; move files to directories or delete them from disk; list the drives mapped to the system; create or delete directories; call the PE Loader; drop and execute a program; run shellcode in a new thread, and more.
“Once again, OceanLotus shows that the team is active and continues to update its toolset. This also demonstrates its intention to remain hidden by picking its targets, limiting the distribution of their malware and using several different servers to avoid attracting attention to a single domain or IP address. The encryption of the payload, together with the side-loading technique – despite its age – is a good way to stay under the radar, since the malicious activities look like they come from the legitimate application,” ESET concludes.

3,APT32,"Campaign Targets Russian-Speaking Enterprises With New Backdoor

A malicious email campaign that has been active for at least two months is targeting Russian-speaking enterprises and delivering a new Windows-based backdoor, Trend Micro warns.
The attack relies on a variety of exploits and Windows components to run malicious scripts in an attempt to make detection and blocking more challenging. The earliest sample associated with the attack was uploaded to VirusTotal on June 6, 2017 and Trend Micro observed five spam runs from June 23 to July 27, 2017. The campaign is believed to be ongoing.
Targets in this attack included financial institutions (such as banks) and mining firms. Trend Micro's researchers noticed that the attackers have diversified their tactics by sending different, targeted emails for each run. Because of the emails’ limited distribution and specificity in social engineering lures, they should be considered part of a spear-phishing campaign, Trend Micro says.
The emails look as if they come from sales and billing departments and contain a malformed Rich Text Format (RTF) file that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) in Microsoft Office’s Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface that was patched in April (the flaw is still being abused by threat actors such as Cobalt and CopyKittens).
Once the exploit code was executed, it downloads a fake XLS file embedded with malicious JavaScript. When opened, the Excel header is ignored and the file is treated as an HTML Application file by the Windows component mshta.exe.
The JavaScript code calls the odbcconf.exe normal executable, which performs various tasks associated with Microsoft Data Access Components, to run the DLL. Once executed, the DLL drops a file in the %APPDATA% folder and appends the .TXT extension to it, although this is an SCT file (Windows scriptlet) normally used to declare variables, define expressions, and add functional codes in web pages, but packed with malicious, obfuscated JavaScript as part of this attack.
The DLL calls the Regsvr32 (Microsoft Register Server) command-line utility to execute with specific parameters. Called Squiblydoo, this attack method abuses Regsvr32 to bypass restrictions on running scripts and evade application whitelisting protections such as AppLocker, and was previously associated with the activities of Vietnamese hacking group APT32.
“While Squiblydoo is already a known attack vector, this is the first time we’ve seen it combined with odbcconf.exe,” Trend Micro notes.
Next, another XML file is executed, after being downloaded from the domain wecloud[.]biz. This is the main backdoor used in this attack, which is executed using the same Regsvr32-abusing Squiblydoo attack technique.
The backdoor is a SCT file with obfuscated JavaScript code inside and supports commands that “essentially allow attackers to take over an infected system.” The backdoor attempts to connect to the command and control (C&C) server at hxxps://wecloud[.]biz/mail/ajax[.]php and retrieve tasks.
Based on the received commands, the malware can download and execute Portable Executable (PE) files, delete files/startup entries and terminate, download additional/new scripts, run new script and terminate current script, or run command shell commands.
“While the later stages of the infection chain required the use of various Windows components, the entry point still involves the use of a Microsoft Office exploit. Patching and keeping software up-to-date will protect users. Alternately, employing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, virtual patching, and URL categorization, as well as enforcing robust patch management policies, will significantly reduce the system’s attack surface,” Trend Micro notes.

4,APT32,"Vietnamese Spies Rival Notorious Russian Group in Sophistication

The campaigns of a cyber espionage group believed to be operating out of Vietnam have become increasingly sophisticated, up to the point where they rival operations launched by the notorious Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as Turla, incident response firm Volexity said on Monday.
The group, tracked as OceanLotus and APT32, has been around since at least 2012, targeting various types of organizations in Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Philippines and China, with some campaigns extending to Europe and the United States. The list of targeted entities includes governments, journalists, activists, tech firms, consumer product manufacturers, banks, and organizations in the hospitality sector.
OceanLotus has used both Windows and Mac malware in its operations, along with some clever techniques that have allowed the group to evade detection.
Volexity has been tracking the threat actor since May 2017, specifically attacks aimed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and media, human rights, and civil society organizations. The security firm agrees with FireEye’s previous assessment that OceanLotus is likely based in Vietnam.
“Volexity believes the size and scale of this attack campaign have only previously been rivaled by a Russian APT group commonly referred to as Turla,” the security firm said in a blog post.
Volexity’s analysis showed that OceanLotus’s watering hole attacks involved more than 100 compromised websites belonging to government, military, media, civil society, human rights and oil exploitation entities.
Researchers determined that the group’s attacks are highly targeted; the compromised sites served malicious code only to visitors who were on a whitelist. Targeted users are shown a fake screen designed to trick them into authorizing a malicious Google app that could access the victim’s emails and contacts. Some of the compromised websites were also set up to deliver backdoors and other types of tools, including legitimate software (e.g. Cobalt Strike) and custom malware.
Researchers also noticed that the attackers created many fake domains designed to mimic legitimate services such as AddThis, Akamai, Baidu, Cloudflare, Disqus, Facebook and Google. Many of these websites leveraged SSL certificates provided by Let’s Encrypt, whose services have been increasingly abused by cybercriminals.
“Volexity believes the OceanLotus threat group has rapidly advanced its capabilities and is now one of the more sophisticated APT actors currently in operation,” the company concluded.
OceanLotus’ sophistication was also described recently in a report from Cybereason, which detailed the group’s cat-and-mouse games within the systems of a global company operating in Asia.

5,APT32,"New macOS Backdoor Linked to Cyber-espionage Group

A recently discovered macOS backdoor is believed to be a new version of malware previously associated with the OceanLotus cyber-espionage group, Trend Micro says.
Also known as APT 32, APT-C-00, SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty, OceanLotus is believed to be operating out of Vietnam and  has been targeting high-profile corporate and government organizations in Southeast Asia. Well-resourced and determined, the group uses custom-built malware and already established techniques.
Some of the group’s targets include human rights organizations, media organizations, research institutes, and maritime construction firms.
The newly discovered macOS backdoor, which Trend Micro detects as OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D, has been observed on machines that have the Perl programming language installed.
The malware is being distributed via malicious documents attached to emails. The document masquerades as the registration form for an event with HDMC, an organization in Vietnam that advertises national independence and democracy.
The document contains malicious, obfuscated macros with a payload written in Perl. The macro extracts an XML file from the Word document. This file is an executable acting as the dropper for the final payload, which is the backdoor.
The dropper, which has all of its strings encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256 key, is also used to establish the backdoor’s persistence on the infected systems. The dropper checks whether it runs as root or not, and uses different path and filename based on that.
The dropper sets the backdoor’s attributes to “hidden” and uses random values for the file date and time, and deletes itself at the end of the process.
The backdoor has two main functions, which collect platform information and sending it to the command and control (C&C) server. It can also receive additional C&C communication information, which is encrypted before being sent.
“Malicious attacks targeting Mac devices are not as common as its counterparts, but the discovery of this new macOS backdoor that is presumably distributed via phishing email calls for every user to adopt best practices for phishing attacks regardless of operating system,” Trend Micro concludes.

6,APT32,"Breaches Increasingly Discovered Internally: Mandiant

Organizations are getting increasingly better at discovering data breaches on their own, with more than 60% of intrusions in 2017 detected internally, according to FireEye-owned Mandiant.
The company’s M-Trends report for 2018 shows that the global median time for internal detection dropped to 57.5 days in 2017, compared to 80 days in the previous year. Of the total number of breaches investigated by Mandiant last year, 62% were discovered internally, up from 53% in 2016.
On the other hand, it still took roughly the same amount of time for organizations to learn that their systems had been compromised. The global median dwell time in 2017 – the median time from the first evidence of a hack to detection – was 101 days, compared to 99 days in 2016.
Companies in the Americas had the shortest median dwell time (75.5 days), while organizations in the APAC region had the longest dwell time (nearly 500 days).

Data collected by Mandiant in 2013 showed that more than one-third of organizations had been attacked again after the initial incident had been remediated. More recent data, specifically from the past 19 months, showed that 56% of Mandiant customers were targeted again by either the same group or one with similar motivation.
In cases where investigators discovered at least one type of significant activity (e.g. compromised accounts, data theft, lateral movement), the targeted organization was successfully attacked again within one year. Organizations that experienced more than one type of significant activity were attacked by more than one threat actor.
Again, the highest percentage of companies attacked multiple times and by multiple threat groups was in the APAC region – more than double compared to the Americas and the EMEA region.
When it comes to the most targeted industries, companies in the financial and high-tech sectors recorded the highest number of significant attacks, while the high-tech, telecommunications and education sectors were hit by the highest number of different hacker groups.
Last year, FireEye assigned names to four state-sponsored threat groups, including the Vietnam-linked APT32 (OceanLotus), and the Iran-linked APT33, APT34 (OilRig), and APT35 (NewsBeef, Newscaster and Charming Kitten).
“Iran-sponsored threat actors have compromised a variety of organizations, but recently they have expanded their efforts in a way that previously seemed beyond their grasp,” Mandiant said in its report. “Today they leverage strategic web compromises (SWC) to ensnare more victims, and concurrently maintain persistence across multiple organizations for months and sometimes years. Rather than relying on publicly available malware and utilities, they develop and deploy custom malware. When they are not carrying out destructive attacks against their targets, they are conducting espionage and stealing data like professionals.”
