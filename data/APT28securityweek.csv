0,APT28,"FireEye Links Russia to Cyber Espionage Campaign Dating Back to 2007


Security firm FireEye has released a new report uncovering and detailing a large cyber-espionage campaign that the company believes is sponsored by the Russian government and dates back to 2007.
The group behind the campaign, which FireEye is calling APT28, is a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues that would clearly benefit Russia.
Unlike many attacks often attributed to China and detailed in Mandiant’s (now part of FireEye) APT1 report released in 2013, the APT28 attackers do not appear to be after intellectual property theft for economic gain. FireEye said the attackers have not been seen trying to steal and profit from financial account information.
""This threat group has ben tracked pretty heavily by the community over the last six months,” Dan McWhorter, FireEye VP of Threat Intelligence, told SecurityWeek. Other researchers and firms have referred to the malware used in the attacks as “Sofacy,” McWhorter said.
Last week, Trend Micro released a report on a cyber-espionage operation dubbed ""Operation Pawn Storm"" which targeted military, government and media organizations around the world and utilized the Sofacy malware.
But according to McWhorter, the direct link and attribution to Russia is what FireEye is highlighting in its APT28 report.
According to FireEye, the threat actors behind APT28 are after insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. Targets include the Caucasus (particularly the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations.
""APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe,"" FireEye reported.
FireEye’s analysis also revealed that APT28 has been “systematically updating their malware” since 2007 and are supported by developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility.
Based on the analysis of the pieces of malware used by the threat group, researchers determined that more than 96% of the samples have been compiled between Monday and Friday, with close to 90% of them built between 8AM and 6PM UTC+4, which corresponds to the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
“We feel we tied together enough evidence to make it conclusive that Russia was the government sponsoring the activity,” McWhorter said.
Tools leveraged by the APT28 attackers include the SOURFACE downloader, a second stage backdoor called EVILTOSS, and a modular family of implants written in C++ that FireEye calls CHOPSTICK.
Features of CHOPSTICK include the ability to collect detailed information from infected host machines including the Windows version, CPU architecture, Windows Firewall state, User Account Control configuration settings on Windows Vista and above and Internet Explorer settings. The malware also tests for the installation of specific security products and applications, FireEye said.
Interestingly, the report (PDF) explained that that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors could contain “vastly different functionality”, depending on which modules were included at compile time.
Similar to many other attacks, APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims.
The attackers have attempted to obfuscate their code and utilize techniques to make analysis challenging, FireEye said, including counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions and creating much “unnecessary noise” in the disassembly. Additionally, the malware leverages runtime checks, attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis (virtual) environment, and if so, remain dormant and do not launch their payloads.
APT28 Targets
According to FireEye, APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and a U.S. defense contractor that was training the Georgian military.
The attackers also zoned in on a specific journalist covering issues in the Caucasus region, and had interest those involved in the Baltic Host, an annual logistics planning exercise hosted by either Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania, all of which Border Russia. 
“Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships,” FireEye said.
Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated NATO domain names, including those of NATO Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO Future Forces Exhibition.
The threat actors also targeted attendees of European defense exhibitions, including the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo.
Other “probable” targets identified by FireEye include:
• Norwegian Army (Forsvaret)
• Government of Mexico
• Chilean Military
• Pakistani Navy
• U.S. Defense Contractors
• European Embassy in Iraq
• Special Operations Forces Exhibition (SOFEX) in Jordan
• Defense Attaches in East Asia
• Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
• Al-Wayi News Site
At the time of publishing the report, FireEye had identified 103 malware samples that says were attributed to APT28, but McWhorter believes there is a great deal more.
Earlier this month, iSight Partners revealed that a threat group allegedly linked with the Russian government had been leveraging a Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerability to target NATO, the European Union, and various private energy and telecommunications organizations in Europe. The group has been dubbed the ""Sandworm Team"" and it has been using weaponized PowerPoint files in its recent attacks.
According to researchers at Trend Micro, the Sandworm team may also have their eyes set on compromising SCADA-based systems.",https://www.securityweek.com/fireeye-links-russia-cyber-espionage-campaign-dating-back-2007
1,APT28,"Microsoft Disrupts Election-Related Domains Used by Russian Hackers

Microsoft on Monday announced that it took control of several domains associated with a notorious Russia-linked threat actor. The names of the domains suggest the hackers may have been using them in campaigns related to the upcoming midterm elections in the United States.
The tech giant’s Digital Crimes Unit obtained a court order to take control of six domains created by a threat group tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sednit, Tsar Team and Sofacy.
APT28, which experts believe is sponsored by Russia’s GRU intelligence agency, has been known to launch politics-focused campaigns, including ones aimed at the latest presidential elections in the United States and France. The group may now be targeting the upcoming midterm elections in the U.S.
The domains seized by Microsoft are my-iri.org, hudsonorg-my-sharepoint.com, senate.group, adfs-senate.services, adfs-senate.email and office365-onedrive.com.
The first domain appears to mimic the International Republican Institute, a non-profit that receives funding from the U.S. government to promote democracy around the world. The second domain appears to impersonate the Hudson Institute, a politically conservative non-profit think tank. The other domains mimic the website of the U.S. Senate and Microsoft’s Office 365 service.
While the domains may have been set up for election-related campaigns, Microsoft says it currently has no evidence that any of them were successfully used in attacks, and it’s unclear exactly who the hackers intended on targeting using these domains.
The company revealed last month that it had spotted some Microsoft phishing domains that had apparently been set up as part of attacks aimed at the campaigns of three congressional candidates who are running in the upcoming midterm elections.
“Microsoft has notified both nonprofit organizations. Both have responded quickly, and Microsoft will continue to work closely with them and other targeted organizations on countering cybersecurity threats to their systems. We’ve also been monitoring and addressing domain activity with Senate IT staff the past several months, following prior attacks we detected on the staffs of two current senators,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post.
This is not the first time Microsoft has seized domains used by APT28. The company says it has used court orders a total of 12 times over the past two years to shut down 84 fake websites linked to the threat group.
Sean Sullivan, Security Advisor at F-Secure, cautioned that the domains targeted by Microsoft may not necessarily be related to elections.
“Microsoft’s announcement is generating a lot of attention and the focus is overwhelmingly centered on the 2018 mid-term elections. But it’s important not to lose sight of the bigger issue,” Sullivan told SecurityWeek. “The focus on think tanks holding pro-sanction views on Russia’s current regime is about espionage. In short: spies are going to spy. That’s true whether or not it’s an election year. There seems to be a rush to conclude that these six domains are part of an “attack” on the elections that risks missing the complete threat model – and therefore the complete countermeasures that should be taken.”
Microsoft took this opportunity to announce its new AccountGuard initiative, which provides free cybersecurity protection to candidates, campaigns and political institutions using Office 365.
The AccountGuard service, which is part of Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program, involves notifications about threats, security guidance and education, and the opportunity to test preview releases of new security features.
AccountGuard is currently available only in the United States, but Microsoft plans on offering it in other countries as well in the coming months.",https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-disrupts-election-related-domains-used-russian-hackers
2,APT28,"Russian Hackers Exploit Recently Patched Flash Vulnerability

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group known as APT28 has been using a recently patched Adobe Flash Player vulnerability in attacks aimed at government organizations and aerospace companies, security firm Proofpoint reported on Thursday.
The Flash Player flaw in question, CVE-2017-11292, was patched by Adobe on October 16. At the time when the patch was released, the vulnerability had a zero-day status, as it had been exploited in targeted attacks by a Middle Eastern threat actor named BlackOasis to deliver FinFisher spyware.
APT28, which is also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team, started launching attacks using CVE-2017-11292 on October 18, Proofpoint said. It’s unclear if APT28 discovered the exploit on its own, purchased it, or reverse engineered the one used in the BlackOasis attack.
Nevertheless, Proofpoint pointed out that the cyberspies are likely trying to take advantage of the recently fixed vulnerability before Adobe’s patch is widely deployed by users.
The attacks observed by the security firm were aimed at organizations in the United States, Europe and other countries. The targets included foreign government organizations with responsibilities similar to the U.S. State Department, and private-sector aerospace companies.
The messages delivering the exploits were highly targeted and they were sent out using free email services, Proofpoint said. The attackers leveraged malicious documents and their previously known Flash Player exploit platform named DealersChoice to deliver the first-stage implant, specifically a reconnaissance tool.
While CVE-2017-11292 affects Windows, Mac and Linux systems, APT28 apparently only launched attacks against Windows users. Tests conducted by researchers showed that the exploit works on systems with Windows 7 or Windows 10 with Microsoft Office 2013. The exploit, however, fails to execute on 64-bit systems running Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (RS3) and Office 2016.
“APT28 is a sophisticated state-sponsored group that is using the vulnerability to attack potentially high-value targets but it is likely that other threat actors will follow suit and attempt to exploit this vulnerability more widely, whether in exploit kits or via other attack vectors,” Proofpoint researchers explained.
The security firm has been working on taking down the command and control (C&C) domains used in these attacks.

3,APT28,"Russian Hackers Used Two Zero-Days in Recent Targeted Attack: FireEye


FireEye said on Saturday that it recently detected a highly targeted attack exploiting two zero-day vulnerabilities in an effort to compromise an “international government entity” in an industry vertical that aligns with known targets hit by a threat actor group which FireEye calls APT28.
FireEye has described APT28 as a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues that would clearly benefit Russia. The security firm previously traced cyber-espionage campaigns by the group that date back to 2007.
FireEye said that it first detected the attacks on April 13th, 2015, when the attackers attempted to exploit two zero-day vulnerabilities, including a recently patched flaw in Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-3043) and a brand new one in Microsoft Windows (CVE-2015-1701).
Through its analysis and technical indicators and command and control infrastructure, FireEye believes that the APT28 attackers are responsible for the campaign, which it is calling ""Operation RussianDoll"".
Despite use of the two zero-days, the attackers were said to be unsuccessful in breaching their target. A FireEye spokesperson told SecurityWeek that it detected the exploits as they were delivered which prevented an intrusion.
According to FireEye, the exploit process takes place like this:
1.	User clicks link to attacker controlled website
2.	HTML/JS launcher page serves Flash exploit
3.	Flash exploit triggers CVE-2015-3043, executes shellcode
4.	Shellcode downloads and runs executable payload
5.	Executable payload exploits local privilege escalation (CVE-2015-1701) to steal System token
The CVE-2015-3043 exploit delivers a malware variant that shares characteristics with the APT28 backdoors CHOPSTICK and CORESHELL malware families, both described in FireEye’s initial report on APT28.
“One of the C2 locations for the new payload, 87.236.215[.]246, also hosts a suspected APT28 domain ssl-icloud[.]com,” FireEye said.
The payload contains an exploit for the unpatched local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701 in Microsoft Windows. The exploit does not affect Windows 8 and later.
“While there is not yet a patch available for the Windows vulnerability, updating Adobe Flash to the latest version will render this in-the-wild exploit innocuous,” FireEye noted in a blog post. “We have only seen CVE-2015-1701 in use in conjunction with the Adobe Flash exploit for CVE-2015-3043. We are working with the Microsoft Security Team on CVE-2015-1701.”
“Because CVE-2015-3043 is already patched, this remote exploit will not succeed on a fully patched system,” FireEye said. “If an attacker wanted to exploit CVE-2015-1701, they would first have to be executing code on the victim’s machine. Baring authorized access to the victim’s machine, the attacker would have to find some other means, such as crafting a new Flash exploit, to deliver a CVE-2015-1701 payload.”
Earlier this week, Trend Micro reported new activity on “Operation Pawn Storm” which is assumed to be the same threat actors tracked by FireEye as APT28. According to the most recent report from Trend Micro, the APT group has introduced new infrastructure and is ""zeroing in"" on targets including the White House and NATO members.
Trend Micro also eluded to possible connections with the Russian government. “We determined that the group also aimed its attacks on Russian dissidents and those opposing the Kremlin, as well as Ukrainian activists and military, which has led some to speculate that there might be a connection with the Russian government,” Feike Hacquebord, a Senior Threat Researcher at Trend Micro, noted in a blog post on Thursday.
Last year FireEye was able to trace at least two specific attempts by APT28 to target the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and a U.S. defense contractor that was training the Georgian military.

4,APT28,"Russian Hackers Used Two Zero-Days in Recent Targeted Attack: FireEye

5,APT28,"Who Hacked French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's Campaign?

One thing is clear. The campaign of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron was hacked prior to the French presidential election this last Sunday -- and the finger was immediately pointed at Russia's APT28 (Fancy Bear). Russia has been caught meddling in western politics once again.
Evidence of APT28 involvement seems to come from three sources: the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), security researchers, and circumstantial. The NSA was quick to blame Russia via a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday this week. The head of the NSA, Admiral Mike Rogers, told the committee that the NSA had warned its French counterparts at the time of the hack: ""Look, we're watching the Russians, we're seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure."" The Russians are here.
Evidence from security researchers focuses on two areas: phishing sites and leaked document metadata. One phishing site, apparently created by APT28 on March 25, 2017 and clearly designed for the Macron campaign, 'onedrive-en-marche-dot-fr', was reported by Trend Micro in April. Other sites apparently tied to the APT28 infrastructures include portal-office-dot-fr, accounts-office-dot-fr and mail-en-marche-dot-fr -- and another with the surprising name of totally-legit-cloud-dot-email.
The document evidence includes the discovery of Cyrillic characters within some documents apparently leaked by the hackers. WikiLeaks tweeted on Saturday (the day before the French presidential vote), ""#MacronLeaks assessment update: several Office files have Cyrillic meta data..."" The obvious assumption is that Russian APT hackers altered the files before leaking them.
But while clearly suggesting possible APT28 involvement in the hack, French security researcher x0rz has demonstrated that neither of these can be taken as actual proof. In a blog post on Tuesday, he demonstrated the ease with which anybody could edit metadata and pretend to be anyone. He went further to explain how ""I setup my own domain mimicking some APT28 artefacts: totally-legit-cloud-dot-email that has been registered using the same information as another APT28 phishing domain used during the attack on EM staff... This domain (that I own) is now linked with actual APT28 infrastructure according to some threat intelligence OSINT tools"" (eg, threatcrowd.org).
In other words, anyone could have established the APT28-related phishing domains, and anyone could have planted Cyrillic characters in the metadata. x0rz believes that all this proves is that it might have been APT28, but it might not have been APT28.
The circumstantial evidence is that the hack follows the basic pattern used by (what everybody believes to have been) APT28 in the US election hacks: phish for the emails of the candidate you want to lose, and then leak them. This evidence claims that since this is what APT28 does, and this is what Russia would want, then therefore this was done by Russia.
But the parallel is not perfect. The Macron hack occurred far later in the election campaign than the DNC hack; the phishing emails appear to be far clumsier; and the email leak occurred too late to have any effect on the election outcome.
The Macron campaign's answer to this is that they were expecting hackers, that they knew they would not be able to prevent a hack, and they prepared for it with what amounts to the 'deception defense'. The New York Times reported, ""'We created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,' Mr. Mahjoubi [the campaign's digital director] said. 'I don't think we prevented them. We just slowed them down,' he said. 'Even if it made them lose one minute, we're happy'.""
SecurityWeek talked to Kevin Eley, VP EMEA at TrapX, about the deception defense. In full, it amounts to the installation of a honeypot-like platform within the customer's infrastructure. Attackers are diverted towards the false shares, false databases, false structure -- and as soon as anything attempts to access them, the existence of an intruder is confirmed. The intrusion can then be tracked back to its source and the vulnerability closed. And if the intruder does manage to exfiltrate any data, it is false data.
""In the Macron hack,"" he told SecurityWeek, ""the deception seems to be at the data level only."" He confirmed that although this could not have been achieved by the campaign on the fly, it could have been done well in advance anticipating a hack. In other words, it can explain but does not prove why the leak occurred so late -- the attackers simply didn't know what to leak.
Just to confuse the issue further, Tyler Durden, discussing the Shadow Brokers' most recent leaks, writes today on zerohedge, ""Inside the NSA dump among many other findings, we find hundreds of NSA attacks on China, as well as penetration attempts in which the NSA 'pretends' to be China so one wonders how difficult it would be for the NSA to pretend they are, oh, say Russia?""
So, who did hack Macron? The obvious conclusion is Russia; because Russia would benefit most from a Le Pen victory. But the timing of the document leaks was far too late to benefit Le Pen, and would more likely benefit Macron. The Occupy Movement could alternatively say that the 1% would benefit from an ex-Rothschild banker (Macron); just as they would benefit from a Republican president and a City of London not controlled by Brussels. It is not just Russia that has an incentive in meddling.
""As far as attribution related to the hacks Macron's campaign suffered, or the origins of the stolen documents,"" F-Secure researcher Andy Patel told SecurityWeek, ""fingers are being pointed based on 'who would/wouldn't do something like this?' by people who don't have access to enough evidence to be 100% certain of anything.""
The bottom line is that we do not know who hacked Macron, nor why. It might have had nothing to with discrediting Macron per se, but merely to add to the current confusion over real and fake news on the internet. ""If it's information warfare -- rather than cyber warfare,"" suggests F-Secure security advisor Sean Sullivan, ""then the point is not stealth. It's to make the point that your systems are under attack, your options are limited, and you always need to be on your guard. And there's nothing you or your leaders can do to stop us!
""Nothing is certain. But that's probably also exactly the goal of the information warfare, to get you to believe in nothing.""",https://www.securityweek.com/who-hacked-french-president-elect-emmanuel-macrons-campaign
6,APT28,"Cyberattack 'Ongoing' Against German Government Network

The German government's IT network is under an ""ongoing"" cyberattack"", the parliamentary committee on intelligence affairs said Thursday, without confirming a media report that Russian hackers were behind the assault.
""It is a real cyberattack on parts of the government system. It's an ongoing process, an ongoing attack,"" said Armin Schuster, chairman of the committee, adding that no further details could be given to avoid passing crucial information on to the attackers.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the hacking was ""a technically sophisticated attack that had been planned for some time"", adding that it had been brought under control.
The highly professional assault had been monitored by the security agencies in order to gain insights into the mode of attack and its targets, said de Maiziere.
German news agency DPA, which first reported the attack the previous day, said Thursday, citing unnamed security sources, that the likely authors were the Russian cyber espionage group ""Snake"".
DPA had earlier pointed at the Russian hacker group APT28, which has been accused of attacks on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign as well as on Germany's parliamentary IT system in 2015.
German security authorities had only detected the online spying in December, DPA has reported, adding that it had infiltrated the systems of the foreign and interior ministries. Konstantin von Notz, deputy of the committee, complained it was ""completely unacceptable"" that members of the oversight body only learnt of the attack through the media.
- Russian hackers -
Top security officials had repeatedly warned during Germany's 2017 general election campaign that Russian hackers may seek to influence or disrupt the polls.
While authorities did not have concrete proof, they have blamed the malware attack that crippled the Bundestag parliamentary network in 2015 for days on the APT28, also known as ""Fancy Bear"" or ""Sofacy"".
The attack netted 17 gigabytes of data which, officials feared, could be used to blackmail MPs or discredit them.
In a separate assault, several German political parties were in September 2016 sent fake emails purporting to be from NATO headquarters which contained a link that installed spying software on victims' computers.
The emails affected party operations such as a regional network of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the federal offices of the far-left Die Linke party.
Amid the rising frequency of attacks, Germany's defence ministry in 2016 set up a cyber department to coordinate the response to online intrusions.
Merkel, seeking to prepare the German public for more online attacks, has said people should ""not allow themselves to be irritated"" by such rogue operations.

7,APT28,"Russian Spies Lure Targets With NATO Cybersecurity Conference

A cyber espionage group linked to Russia has been trying to deliver malware to targeted individuals using documents referencing a NATO cybersecurity conference, Cisco’s Talos research team reported on Monday.
The attack has been linked to the notorious threat actor known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Group 74, Sednit, Tsar Team and Strontium.
The campaign was apparently aimed at individuals interested in the CyCon U.S. conference organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in collaboration with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point on November 7-8 in Washington, D.C. The hackers created malicious documents with information that was copied from the official CyCon U.S. website.
The topic used as bait in this attack suggests that the threat actor targeted individuals with an interest in cyber security.
APT28 has been known to use zero-day exploits in its operations and, earlier this month, researchers noticed that the hackers had started leveraging a Flash Player vulnerability that Adobe had patched just two days prior. However, in the campaign analyzed by Cisco Talos, the attackers did not use any zero-days.
Instead, they relied on Office documents containing a VBA script. The goal was to deliver Seduploader, a piece of malware which has been used by the threat actor in other NATO-related attacks as well.
“In the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection vector, the payload was executed in the Office word process. In this campaign, adversaries did not use any exploit. Instead, the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe,” researchers explained.
Seduploader is a reconnaissance malware capable of capturing screenshots, collecting and exfiltrating information about the system, executing code, and downloading files. The variant used in these attacks is slightly different compared to previously known samples, which is likely an attempt to evade detection.
The CCDCOE published an alert on its website on Monday to warn people interested in the CyCon conference about the attack.
“This is clearly an attempt to exploit the credibility of Army Cyber Institute and NATO CCDCOE in order to target high-ranking officials and experts of cyber security,” the organization said.
APT28 is not the only threat actor to use cyber security conferences as a lure in their operations. Last year, Palo Alto Networks reported that a China-linked espionage group known as Lotus Blossom, Elise and Esile had used fake invitations to the company’s Cybersecurity Summit to trick users into installing malware.

8,APT28,"Russian Hackers Target Montenegro as Country Joins NATO

Hackers linked to Russia launched cyberattacks on the Montenegro government just months before the country joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and experts believe these attacks will likely continue.
Despite strong opposition from Russia, Montenegro officially joined NATO on June 5. Russia has threatened to retaliate but it may have already taken action against Montenegro in cyberspace.
Attacks aimed at the Montenegro government spotted earlier this year by security firm FireEye leveraged malware and exploits associated with the Russia-linked threat group known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team.
APT28 has been known to target Montenegro. In the latest attacks observed by researchers, the hackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious documents pertaining to a NATO secretary meeting and a visit by a European army unit to Montenegro. Experts believe the latter document may have been stolen and weaponized by the attackers.
The malware delivered in these attacks is tracked by FireEye as GAMEFISH and it has been exclusively used by APT28. GAMEFISH is a backdoor that is tracked by other security firms as Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT and Sofacy.
The malicious documents delivered the malware via a Flash exploit framework. FireEye has privately informed its customers about this framework, but it has not detailed it in any public reports. However, the company told SecurityWeek that this framework is also known as DealersChoice, which Palo Alto Networks analyzed in October 2016.
FireEye analyst Ben Read told SecurityWeek that the malicious documents first profile the targeted system in an effort to determine which version of Flash Player is present. A command and control (C&C) server is then contacted and the appropriate Flash exploit is downloaded. The exploits, which can include CVE-2015-7645 and CVE-2016-7855, are used to deliver GAMEFISH.
Read said it was unclear if APT28’s attacks against the Montenegro government were successful.
“It’s likely that this activity is a part of APT28’s continued focus on targeting various NATO member states, as well as the organization itself,” said Tony Cole, VP and CTO for Global Government at FireEye.
“Russia has strongly opposed Montenegro's NATO accession process and is likely to continue using cyber capabilities to undermine Montenegro's smooth integration into the alliance,” Cole added. “Montenegro's accession could increase cyber threat activity directed toward NATO, and provide additional avenues for adversaries like Russia to illicitly access NATO information.”
APT28 has been known to target NATO member countries, including by leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities. The group has also been involved in the recent U.S. election attacks.
While the threat actor is widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations. The country’s president, Vladimir Putin, recently claimed that patriotic hackers from Russia could be behind these attacks, but denied that the government is involved in hacking activities.

9,APT28,"Russia-Linked Spies Deliver Malware via DDE Attack

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group tracked as APT28 and Fancy Bear has started delivering malware to targeted users by leveraging a recently disclosed technique involving Microsoft Office documents and a Windows feature called Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).
Researchers at McAfee noticed the use of the DDE technique while analyzing a campaign that involved blank documents whose name referenced the recent terrorist attack in New York City.
Researchers warned recently that DDE, a protocol designed for data exchanges between Windows applications, could be used by hackers as a substitute for macros in attacks involving malicious documents. Shortly after, security firms reported seeing attacks leveraging DDE to deliver malware, including Locky ransomware.
Microsoft pointed out that DDE, which has been replaced with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), is a legitimate feature. The company has yet to make any changes that would prevent attacks, but mitigations included in Windows do provide protection, and users are shown two warnings before the malicious content is executed.
In the APT28 attacks spotted by McAfee, cyberspies used the document referencing the New York City attack to deliver a first-stage malware tracked as Seduploader. The malware, typically used by the threat actor as a reconnaissance tool, is downloaded from a remote server using PowerShell commands.
Based on the analysis of the malware and command and control (C&C) domains used in the attack, researchers determined that the campaign involving DDE started on October 25.
The attack using the New York City incident as lure appears to be part of a campaign that also involved documents referencing Saber Guardian, a multinational military exercise conducted by the U.S. Army in Eastern Europe in an effort to deter an invasion (by Russia) into NATO territory.
Another recent APT28 attack leveraged a document describing CyCon U.S., a conference organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in collaboration with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point. However, the CyCon attack relied on a malicious VBA script and it did not involve DDE.
“Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press, it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses,” McAfee researchers said in a blog post.
“[The] use of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight APT28’s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations,” they added.

10,APT28,"Pawn Storm Cyberspies Target German Ruling Party

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group Pawn Storm has been observed targeting the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the political party of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Last year, researchers reported that servers in the German Parliament (Bundestag) were infected with malware by Pawn Storm, which is also known as APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, Fancy Bear and Tsar Team.
Trend Micro discovered in April that the threat actor was launching credential phishing attacks against the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and high-profile users of German freemail providers GMX and WEB.DE.
The attackers set up a fake CDU webmail server in Latvia, and three phishing domains for web.de and gmx.de using a VPS provider registered in the United Arab Emirates. Trend Micro previously reported that this provider, which has servers in the Netherlands and Romania, was used by Pawn Storm in at least 80 high profile attacks aimed at governments around the world.
“Pawn Storm attackers often conduct sophisticated, simultaneous attacks against targets’ corporate and personal email accounts. The attackers build a fake version of the corporate webmail server of the targeted organization and at the same attack key members of the organization on their private free webmail accounts,” said Feike Hacquebord, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro. “Credential phishing is an important espionage tool: we have witnessed Pawn Storm downloading complete online e-mail boxes and securing future access by e.g. setting up a forwarding e-mail addresses secretly.”
“It is a recurring theme in recent Pawn Storm attacks; organizations get hit from different angles simultaneously. We have seen that happening time and time again against various governments, armed forces, defense companies and media,” Hacquebord added.
Pawn Storm has been around for many years and continues to be highly active. Trend Micro reported seeing more than a dozen active command and control (C&C) servers for a piece of malware it calls “X-Agent.” This second-stage malware is used by the threat actor only against high-value targets.
In March, Trend Micro said it had seen Pawn Storm attacks aimed at Turkey, including the government’s Directorate General of Press and Information, the Grand National Assembly, the newspaper Hürriyet, and the Prime Minister’s Office.

11,APT28,"Researchers Dissect Tool Used by Infamous Russian Hacker Group

Sofacy’s First-Stage Malware Zebrocy Analyzed
ESET security researchers have taken a deep dive into one of the tools heavily used by the Russian threat actor Sofacy over the past couple of years.
Dubbed Zebrocy, the tool serves as a first-stage malware in attacks and is comprised of a Delphi downloader, an AutoIt downloader and a Delphi backdoor. Used in multiple attacks, the malicious program often acts as a downloader for the actor’s main backdoor, Xagent.
Also referred to as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, and Strontium, and active since around 2007, the group is focused on cyber espionage and has hit government, military, and defense organizations worldwide.
Supposedly the actor behind attacks targeting the 2016 presidential election in the United States, Sofacy has been known to target Ukraine and NATO countries, and has recently switched focus to targets in Asia.
Coexisting with another Sofacy first-stage tool, Seduploader, the Zebrocy malware has been used in attacks against victims in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay and Zimbabwe, ESET reveals.
Zebrocy is usually delivered via emails carrying malicious attachments and users are lured into opening them. These are either Microsoft Office documents that deliver the payload via VBA macros, exploits, or Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), or archives containing executables with an icon and a document-like filename.
Once the malicious attachment is executed, the first stage of the Zebrocy family is delivered: a Delphi downloader (in some attacks the AutoIt stage was used directly). The downloader is usually masked using document or Windows library icons and some samples are packed with UPX.
When launched, the malware displays a splash window with a bogus error message to distract the user. In the background, however, the malware drops a file under %TEMP% and adds a Windows registry to achieve persistence. It also gathers information on the compromised system and sends it to the command and control (C&C) server via a HTTP POST request.
If the target is considered of interest, the C&C responds with the next stage, the AutoIt downloader, which acts as another layer of the reconnaissance phase. Packing all of the functionality of the Delphi downloader and even more, the AutoIt downloader is sometimes used as the first stage instead.
The tool can detect sandbox and virtual environments and retrieve system information such as: a list of installed software, Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit), process list, hard drive information, and screenshots, along with various details about the computer, gathered using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.
The Delphi backdoor, which is the last stage of the Zebrocy chain of components, has an internal versioning number, unrelated to the campaign it is used in. It embeds configuration data such as: AES keys for C&C communication, URLs, malware version, persistence windows registry key/value, path to store temporary files, and the names of hidden directories to be created to store temporary files.
Once set up, the malware executes callback functions via the Windows API function SetTimer, allowing the attackers to handle features and commands: take a screenshot of the desktop, capture keystrokes, list drives/network resources, read/write into Windows registry, copy/move/delete a file system object, and execute files or create scheduled tasks.
The backdoor supports around 30 commands, which differ from one version to another. For communication purposes, the malware stores the report of these functions on a temp file, then reds the file content and sends it to the C&C.
Zebrocy might be the successor of another malware components written in Delphi that Sofacy is known have used, namely Downdelph. The tool was last seen in September 2015, two months before Zebrocy emerged and both malware families also use a similar deployment method, the researchers note.
“We have seen Zebrocy being heavily used by the Sednit group over the last two years. Our analysis of the many new variants that appeared on a regular basis since 2017 clearly indicates that Zebrocy is being actively maintained and improved by its author(s). We can consider it as one of the stable, mature tools in Sednit’s arsenal, a tool that deserves to be monitored closely,” ESET concludes.

12,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Shift Focus From NATO Countries to Asia

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group known as Sofacy, APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Strontium has shifted its focus from NATO member countries and Ukraine to Central Asia and even further east, Kaspersky Lab reported on Tuesday.
Sofacy, which is believed to be behind attacks targeting the 2016 presidential election in the United States, has been known to target Ukraine and NATO countries. NATO was heavily targeted in early 2017, including with zero-day exploits, but Kaspersky said the group later started to shift its focus towards the Middle East and Central Asia, which had been less targeted in the first half of the year.
According to the security firm, by mid-2017, detections of a Sofacy backdoor tracked as SPLM, CHOPSTICK and X-Agent showed that the hackers had been increasingly targeting former Soviet countries in Central Asia, including telecoms firms and defense-related organizations. The attacks were aimed at countries such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan and Uzbekistan.
Attacks involving SPLM and a tool tracked as Zebrocy were increasingly spotted between the second and fourth quarters of 2017 further east. The list of countries where these pieces of malware were detected by Kaspersky includes China, Mongolia, South Korea and Malaysia.
Zebrocy, which allows attackers to collect data from victims, has been used to target various types of organizations, including accounting firms, science and engineering centers, industrial organizations, ministries, embassies and consulates, national security and intelligence agencies, press and translation services, and NGOs.
As for the infrastructure used in these attacks, researchers pointed out that Sofacy has been fairly consistent throughout the years and many of its techniques and patterns have been publicly disclosed. As a result, Kaspersky expects to see some changes this year.
“Sofacy is one of the most active threat actors we monitor, and it continues to spear-phish its way into targets, often on a remarkable global scale,” explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “Our data and detections show that in 2017, the threat actor further developed its toolset as it moved from high volume NATO spear-phish targeting towards the Middle East and Central Asia, before finally shifting its focus further East. Mass campaigns appear to have given way to subsets of activity and malware involving such tools as Zebrocy and SPLM.”

13,APT28,"Germany Accuses Russia of Hybrid Warfare

Russia has been accused of waging its own brand of cyber hybrid warfare against Germany, with specific focus on next year's elections. In particular, the APT28 (Fancy Bear) hacking group -- thought to be linked to the Russian government -- is accused of spreading propaganda and disinformation under the guise of 'hacktivists'.
The recent attack on Deutsche Telekom routers is thought by some experts to have emanated from Russia, but there is no proof. Last year's attack against the German parliament, and attacks against German politicians in August, are also blamed on Russia. Speaking earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel commented, ""Such cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them.""
Now both the heads of the German foreign intelligence agency (BND), Bruno Kahl, and the domestic intelligence agency (BfV), Hans-Georg Maassen, have warned about increasing Russian cyber activity in Germany. 
Last week Kahl told the Süddeutsche Zeitung, ""There are findings that cyber-attacks take place which have no other meaning than to create political uncertainty. There is a kind of pressure on public discourse and on democracy, which is unacceptable."" He added that there are indications of Russian involvement. ""Attribution to a state actor is technically difficult, but there is some evidence that it is at least tolerated or desired by the state.""
Yesterday, however, a statement issued by the BfV was more forthright. ""Since the start of the Ukraine crisis,"" it started, ""we have seen a significant increase in Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Germany."" It warns of a broad spectrum of instruments and ""an enormous use of financial resources on Russia's part"" designed to strengthen extremist groups in order to shape political discourse in Germany.
The statement names APT28 as using a campaign that is often executed as 'false flags'. ""This approach represents a previously unseen methodology in campaigns that are controlled by Russia."" Note however, that many experts believe that the attack against French television company TV5  was also a 'false flag': in reality APT28 pretending to be ISIS.
The statement goes on to say, ""Spear-phishing against political parties and parliamentary groups have increased dramatically. They are attributed to the APT28 campaign, which was also responsible for the DNC hack. APT28 successfully exfiltrated data from the German Bundestag in 2015.""
Maassen describes the method and motivation behind the APT28 campaign. ""Propaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage are part of hybrid threats against western democracies."" He points to social networks as the new way for people to share and consume information, adding that it provides the perfect entry point for disinformation and campaigns designed to reshape public opinion.
He also warns of an ""increase in cyber espionage within the political arena"". Government officials, members of the Bundestag, and party workers all face a potential threat. ""Stolen information could be used in the election campaign to discredit German politicians.""
The political theory is that Russia will benefit from a weakened European Union -- already wounded by Brexit. By playing to European concerns over uncontrolled immigration and refugee support, and by fostering nationalism within individual member states -- in this instance Germany -- Russia will be able to weaken the existing European sanctions.

14,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Target Hotels in Europe

A notorious Russia-linked hacker group specializing in cyber espionage is believed to be behind an ongoing campaign targeting hotels in several European countries.
FireEye has linked the attacks with moderate confidence to APT28, a threat actor also known as Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium. The group is believed to have launched numerous high-profile attacks, including a campaign targeting last year’s presidential election in the United States.
While the recent attacks have targeted the networks of hotels, the security firm says there is some indication that the hackers may actually be looking to access the devices of government and business travelers via the guest Wi-Fi provided by these hotels.
FireEye has seen attacks targeting several companies in the hospitality sector, including hotels in seven European countries and one Middle Eastern country.
The attacks start with a spear phishing email sent to a hotel employee. The emails carry a document named “Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc,” which uses macros to decode a dropper that deploys GameFish, a piece of malware known to be used by APT28. This backdoor was used recently in a campaign launched by the threat group against Montenegro just as the country had been preparing to join NATO.
Once they gained access to the targeted hotel’s network, the hackers used the NSA-linked EternalBlue SMB exploit, which was also involved in the recent WannaCry and NotPetya outbreaks, to move laterally within the network. Researchers said this was the first time the group had used this exploit.
The cyberspies also used Responder, an open source penetration testing tool developed by Laurent Gaffie of SpiderLabs. They leveraged Responder for NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning.
“This technique listens for NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts from victim computers attempting to connect to network resources. Once received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine. APT28 used this technique to steal usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network,” FireEye researchers explained.
In one incident that occurred in 2016, a user connected to a hotel’s Wi-Fi and 12 hours later their device was accessed by APT28 using stolen credentials. The attackers started moving through the victim’s network and accessed their Outlook Web Access (OWA) account.
While these attacks can be carried out remotely, in this case the attacker appeared to be on the same network and physically close to the victim.
Kaspersky reported recently that APT28 has been using two zero-day vulnerabilities in targeted attacks, and it has started experimenting with new macro techniques.
These are not the only attacks apparently aimed at travelers. Other campaigns include DarkHotel, which some have linked to South Korea, Duqu 2.0, targeting the networks of European hotels hosting participants in Iranian nuclear negotiations, and according to some reports, high-profile people visiting Russia and China may have their devices accessed.
“Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations,” FireEye said. “Business and government personnel who are traveling, especially in a foreign country, must often rely on less secure systems to conduct business than at their home office, or may be unfamiliar with the additional threats posed while abroad.”",https://www.securityweek.com/russian-cyberspies-target-hotels-europe
15,APT28,"Russia-linked Pawn Storm Attackers Exploiting New Adobe Flash Zero-Day


While Adobe released security updates on Tuesday to address multiple security vulnerabilities in Flash Player, Reader and Acrobat, a prominent Russian threat actor group is actively exploiting an unpatched Flash Zero-Day vulnerability in attacks.
According to Trend Micro, the threat group behind Operation Pawn Storm (also known as APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Tsar Team) is using Adobe Flash zero-day exploit code in attacks targeting several Ministries of Foreign Affairs. The attackers, which are believed to be linked to the Russian government, have previously targeted military, defense industry, government and media organizations from across the world.
Despite recent patches issued by Adobe on Oct. 13, this vulnerability is still unpatched, leaving Flash users vulnerable to attacks. The Flash zero-day affects at least Adobe Flash Player versions 19.0.0.185 and 19.0.0.207, the security firm said.
Trend Micro found in its analysis that several Ministries of Foreign Affairs were targeted with spear phishing e-mails containing links to malicious Web sites that hosted the exploit. Subject lines used to entice users to click included many “interesting” events such as:
“Suicide car bomb targets NATO troop convoy Kabul”
“Syrian troops make gains as Putin defends air strikes”
“Israel launches airstrikes on targets in Gaza”
“Russia warns of response to reported US nuke buildup in Turkey, Europe”
“US military reports 75 US-trained rebels return Syria”
Trend Micro researchers Brooks Li, Feike Hacquebord, and Peter Pi explained in a blog post that recent URLs hosting the new Flash zero-day exploits are similar previously used in attacks that targeted NATO members and the White House in April of this year.
“Ministries of Foreign Affairs have become a particular focus of interest for Pawn Storm recently,” the researchers wrote. “Aside from malware attacks, fake Outlook Web Access (OWA) servers were also set up for various ministries. These are used for simple, but extremely effective, credential phishing attacks. One Ministry of Foreign Affairs got its DNS settings for incoming mail compromised. This means that Pawn Storm has been intercepting incoming e-mail to this organization for an extended period of time in 2015.” 
The campaign has also targeted the spouses of senior U.S. officials, Tom Kellermann, Chief Cybersecurity Officer at Trend Micro, told SecurityWeek.
In April, FireEye reported that the threat group had used Flash Player and Windows zero-days in a highly targeted attack aimed at an international government entity. Operation Pawn Storm is assumed to be the same threat actors tracked by FireEye as APT28.
Early this year, Trend Micro found the attackers using malware targeting iOS devices to infect users and steal sensitive information.  
“Pawn Storm has used six zero days in the last year and illustrates organized activity of cyber militias in the former Soviet Bloc,” Kellermann said.
While attribution is always difficult, the Pawn Storm attackers are a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues that would clearly benefit Russia. Other organizations targeted by the group in the past include the Caucasus (particularly the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations. The threat actors have also targeted attendees of European defense exhibitions, including the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo.

16,APT28,"Russian Cyber Espionage Group Planning to Hit Banks: Report

APT28, the notorious cyber espionage group that is believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, is planning to attack various financial institutions from across the world, according to a report published on Tuesday by cybersecurity services and training provider root9B.
APT28 has been around since at least 2007. The threat actor, analyzed by several security firms over the past months, is known under various names, including Pawn Storm, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Tsar Team, and Sofacy. A report published by FireEye in October 2014 showed a direct link between the advanced persistent threat (APT) group and Russia.
FireEye noted in that report that APT28 had not been seen trying to steal and profit from financial account information. However, root9B says it has uncovered plans by the threat group to target international financial institutions.
The list of organizations that appear to be targeted by the attackers includes Bank of America, TD Canada Trust, Regions Bank, the United Nations Children’s Fund, United Bank for Africa, Commercial Bank International (CBI) in the United Arab Emirates, and possibly Germany-based Commerzbank.
The security firm says it has notified authorities in the United States and the UAE, and the security teams of the targeted financial institutions of APT28’s plans.
“While none of the targeted organizations are clients of root9B, we felt it imperative to disclose the findings to them, and as broadly as possible to the security community,” said Eric Hipkins, CEO of root9B.
The security firm said it discovered the threat group’s plans at the end of April during routine security analysis. Researchers stumbled upon a spear-phishing domain aimed at the UAE-based financial organization. The domain attracted the attention of experts because it was hosted on a server known to be associated with state-sponsored operations. They also discovered several pieces of new malware with signatures specific to APT28.
The attackers registered several CBI phishing domains using fictitious information. The phishing domains for the other targeted banks were discovered by researchers because they had been registered using similar fake registration details.
Researchers determined that the malicious actors started preparations for this campaign back in June 2014.
“While the continued vector of the attack remains unclear, root9B assesses that it will most likely be a spear-phishing campaign. This attack vector will likely use a well-crafted email containing either a malicious file or web hyperlink to what recipients believe is the actual website; but is instead a fake landing page,” the security firm wrote in its report.
Experts noted that while such phishing websites are usually utilized to trick users into handing over personal and financial information, it’s possible that the threat group could try to use the servers hosting the phishing pages to deliver malware that gives them access to victims’ networks.",https://www.securityweek.com/russian-cyber-espionage-group-planning-hit-banks-report
17,APT28,"Microsoft Patches Zero-Days Exploited by Russia-Linked Hackers

Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday updates for May 2017 address tens of vulnerabilities, including several zero-day flaws exploited by profit-driven cybercriminals and two notorious Russia-linked cyber espionage groups.
The company has resolved more than 50 security holes affecting Windows, Internet Explorer, Edge, Office, the .NET framework, and Flash Player, for which Adobe released an update on Tuesday.
A blog post published by Microsoft revealed that the company had worked with ESET and FireEye to protect customers against attacks leveraging vulnerabilities in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Office. Both ESET and FireEye have released reports on the attacks they have observed.
FireEye has spotted attacks launched by a couple of cyber espionage groups believed to be connected to the Russian government and an unknown financially-motivated threat actor.
According to the security firm, the group known as Turla, Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear has been exploiting an Office remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-0261 to deliver a custom JavaScript implant dubbed by FireEye “SHIRIME.” The same vulnerability has also been exploited by profit-driven cybercriminals to deliver a new variant of the NETWIRE malware, a threat used by multiple actors over the past years.
The Turla group’s attacks also leveraged CVE-2017-0001 for privilege escalation, while the cybercriminals used CVE-2016-7255 for privilege escalation.
Both FireEye and ESET have observed attacks involving zero-day vulnerabilities launched by the group known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium. This Russia-linked group, which some believe could be behind the recent election cyberattacks in France, has leveraged an Office RCE flaw (CVE-2017-0262) and a Windows privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0263). The malware delivered in these attacks is tracked by the security firms as Seduploader and GAMEFISH.
Microsoft pointed out that the Turla attacks were first spotted in March, and customers who had up-to-date systems had already been protected as CVE-2017-0001 was patched earlier that month. In April, the company also rolled out a defense-in-depth protection designed to prevent EPS attacks by disabling the EPS filter by default.
The updates released by the company this month patch the EPS-related vulnerabilities in Office (CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-0262) to ensure that customers who need to use EPS filters are still protected.
Another zero-day patched by Microsoft on Tuesday is CVE-2017-0222, a memory corruption in Internet Explorer that can be exploited for remote code execution. No information has been shared on the attacks leveraging this security hole.
The tech giant has also addressed four vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed. The list includes an RCE flaw in the JavaScript engines used by web browsers (CVE-2017-0229), a SmartScreen filter-related browser spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2017-0231), a privilege escalation in Edge (CVE-2017-0241), and a Mixed Content warnings bypass in Internet Explorer (CVE-2017-0064).

18,APT28,"Russia-linked Hackers Exploit Lojack Recovery Tool in Attacks

Recently discovered “Lojack” agents containing malicious command and control (C&C) servers point to the Russian cyber-espionage group Sofacy, according to NETSCOUT Arbor.
Previously known as Computrace, Lojack is a legitimate laptop recovery solution used by companies looking to protect assets should they be lost or stolen. It can be used to locate and lock devices remotely, as well as to delete files.
Lojack represents a great double-agent because it is usually considered legitimate software but also allows for remote code execution, NETSCOUT Arbor's Security Engineering and Research Team (ASERT) points out. Moreover, the tool can survive hard drive replacements and operating system re-imaging.
Many of the anti-virus vendors in VirusTotal don’t flag the Lojack executable as malicious, but rather consider it as “not-a-virus” or “Risk Tool.” Additionally, with binary modification of the “small agent” considered trivial, it’s clear that attackers would consider the tool a viable target.
“With low AV detection, the attacker now has an executable hiding in plain sight, a double-agent. The attacker simply needs to stand up a rogue C&C server that simulates the Lojack communication protocols. Finally, Lojack’s ‘small agent’ allows for memory reads and writes which grant it remote backdoor functionality when coupled with a rogue C&C server,” ASERT notes.
The ASERT security researchers observed five Lojack agents that were pointing to four different suspected domains, three of which have been tied to Sofacy.
Also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Strontium, the threat actor is believed to have targeted the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as Ukraine and NATO countries. In fact, the group heavily targeted NATO in early 2017, including with zero-day exploits. The group was also observed shifting focus towards the Middle East and Central Asia last year.
In March 2018, a security researcher revealed that Sofacy attacks overlap with other state-sponsored operations, after the group’s Zerbrocy malware was found on machines compromised by Mosquito, a backdoor associated with the Turla threat actor.
“ASERT assesses with moderate confidence that the rogue Lojack agents are attributed to Fancy Bear based on shared infrastructure with previous operations,” the security researchers say.
Only the presence of a rogue C&C makes the samples malicious, as attackers are merely hijacking the communication used by Lojack, the researchers say. Several of the domains extracted from the rogue agents trace back to Sofacy operations: elaxo[.]org, ikmtrust[.]com, and lxwo[.]org (tied to the group last year), and sysanalyticweb[.]com (spotted only recently).
Although the hijack of the software for malicious purposes is a publicly known tactic, similarities in the binary comparisons and infrastructure analysis increase the possibility that the same actor was behind them.
The domains are associated with the same Lojack agent utilizing the same compile time, contain nonsensical Registrant information (the same information found in multiple fields), a similar nonsensical word used in the Registrant Name field is also used for the Registrant Organization (the field is often skipped, but this actor regularly utilizes both fields).
“Hijacking legitimate software is a common enough tactic for malicious actors. What makes this activity so devious is the binaries hijacked being labeled as legitimate or simple ‘Risk Tool’, rather than malware. As a result, rogue Lojack samples fly under the radar and give attackers a stealthy backdoor into victim systems,” ASERT concludes.

19,APT28,"Attackers Using USB Malware to Steal Data From Air-Gapped Networks

Cyber Espionage Group Uses USB Malware to Steal Data From Closed Networks
Researchers from security firm ESET have analyzed a malicious tool used by a notorious cyber espionage group to steal valuable information from air-gapped networks.
Isolating a sensitive computer network from the Internet can be an efficient security measure, but threat actors have found ways to get around it. A group believed to be linked to the Russian government, know as ""Sednit,"" ""APT28"" and ""Sofacy,"" appears to have developed the tools necessary to achieve this task.
In a recent report on the attacks launched by APT28 against European governments, militaries and security organizations, FireEye revealed that one of the tools used by the group is a modular family of implants called CHOPSTICK. Researchers identified one variant of CHOPSTICK that defeats closed networks by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives.
One such tool used by the threat group was analyzed by ESET. Dubbed Win32/USBStealer, the malware has been used since at least 2005 in campaigns against government organizations in Eastern Europe, researchers said. There are several variants of this threat, but the security firm has focused on analyzing the most sophisticated one.
According to ESET, the USBStealer dropper initially infects a computer within the targeted organization that's connected to the Internet (Computer A). The dropper is disguised as a legitimate Russian application called USB Disk Security.
The dropper monitors the infected device for removable drives. When a removable drive is detected, the malware is copied onto it, and its Autorun file is modified so that USBStealer is executed when the drive is inserted on a different computer. In this phase, the malware also marks the USB drive as having been used on a machine with an Internet connection.
Once the infected drive is connected to an air-gapped computer (Computer B), the malware is transferred onto it. The machine's name is registered on the removable drive, a process which enables the attackers to map the devices they can reach.
The attack only works if Autorun is enabled on the targeted computer. The feature was deactivated by Microsoft in 2009 with the release of a Windows update, but experts say the method could still work considering that air-gapped devices are in many cases out of date due to the lack of an Internet connection.
When the USB drive is once again connected to Computer A, the malware operator drops a series of data exfiltration commands onto it. These commands will be executed as soon as the drive is connected again to Computer B.
The malware is interested in files used by cryptographic applications, and files that appear to be associated with private software. The threat searches for files of interest everywhere on the infected machine, but it avoids folders created by various antiviruses.
Once the stolen files are transferred back to Computer A, the attackers need to use a different piece of malware to copy the data to their own servers because USBStealer doesn't have such capabilities, ESET noted.
Researchers say it's uncertain how the initial infection occurs, but a likely attack vector is spear phishing. FireEye has identified a spear phishing campaign that uses the USB Disk Security application as a lure.

20,APT28,"Sofacy Attacks Overlap With Other State-Sponsored Operations


CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - Attacks carried out by a Russian threat group appear to overlap with campaigns conducted by other cyberspies, including ones linked by researchers to China and the United States.
Kaspersky Lab revealed last month that the Russian threat actor known as Sofacy, APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Strontium had shifted its focus from NATO member countries and Ukraine to Central Asia and further east, including China.
On Friday, at Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), researcher Kurt Baumgartner revealed that the group appears to be particularly interested in military, defense and diplomatic entities in the far east.
Baumgartner also revealed that the attacks launched by Sofacy sometimes overlap with the operations of other state-sponsored cyberspies in terms of victims.
For instance, researchers discovered Sofacy’s Zerbrocy malware on machines that had also been compromised by Mosquito, a backdoor associated with Turla, a different threat actor linked to Russia. Shared victims include diplomatic and commercial organizations in Europe and Asia.
Sofacy’s SPLM malware (aka CHOPSTICK and X-Agent) was found on devices that had also been infected with other Turla malware, which often precedes SPLM.
SPLM has also been spotted on the same systems as malware known to have been used by a China-linked actor known as Danti.
According to Kaspersky, overlaps were generally found on systems belonging to government, technology, science, and military organizations in or based in Central Asia.
Another interesting overlap was between Sofacy and the English-speaking Lamberts group, which is also known as Longhorn. Security firms revealed last year that this cyber espionage group had been using some of the Vault 7 tools leaked by WikiLeaks. These tools are believed to have been developed and used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Kaspersky said it had identified Sofacy backdoors and malware associated with the Lamberts, specifically Grey Lambert, on a server belonging to a military and aerospace conglomerate in China.
Researchers admit, however, that the presence of both Lamberts and Sofacy malware on the server could simply mean that the former planted a false flag, considering that the original delivery vector for the Sofacy tool remains unknown. It’s also possible that the Russian group exploited a previously unknown vulnerability, or that it somehow harnessed the Grey Lambert malware to download its own tools. The most likely scenario, according to experts, is that the Sofacy malware was delivered using an unknown PowerShell script or a legitimate app in which the attackers discovered a flaw.
“Sofacy is sometimes portrayed as wild and reckless, but as seen under our visibility, the group can be pragmatic, measured and agile. Their activity in the East has been largely under-reported, but they are clearly not the only threat actor interested in this region, or even in the same targets,” Baumgartner said. “As the threat landscape grows ever more crowded and complex, we may encounter more examples of target overlap and it could explain why many threat actors check victim systems for the presence of other intruders before fully launching their attacks.”
Kaspersky recently spotted the SPLM malware being used in an attack aimed at major air defense organization in China, while the Zebrocy tool has been used in high volume campaigns targeting entities in Armenia, Turkey, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Japan and China.

21,APT28,"Tech Firms Target Domains Used by Russia-linked Threat Group

Tech companies ThreatConnect and Microsoft are moving toward exposing and taking down domains associated with Russia-linked threat group known as Fancy Bear.
Also tracked as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit, the threat group has been associated with a variety of high-profile cyber-attacks aimed at government and other types of organizations worldwide.
Last year, the threat group was said to have orchestrated election-related hacker attacks in the United States. The actor allegedly developed the so called XTunnel malware specifically to compromise the Democrat National Committee (DNC) network last year, and was said in February 2017 to be using brand new Mac malware to steal data.
ThreatConnect says their team was able to identify “dozens of recently registered domains and IPs that have varying levels of association to the Russian APT.” Moreover, the security firm discovered three name servers the group most likely used for domains, which allows defenders to “proactively identify new domains that may be associated with Fancy Bear activity”.
One of the domains, the security company reveals, is unisecproper[.]org, which was registered using the email address [email protected][.]com and is hosted on a dedicated server at the IP 92.114.92.134. The certificate used by this domain has been already associated (PDF) with Fancy Bear in operations targeting the DNC and German Parliament, which clearly indicates that the domain is associated with the group.
Using the SSL certificate, ThreatConnect discovered recent IPs associated with Fancy Bear, along with numerous domains hosted on these IPs, also supposedly associated with the threat group. Some of these domains were discovered in previous investigations as well.
The researchers also managed to find name servers used by Fancy Bear, including nemohosts[.]com, bacloud[.]com, and laisvas[.]lt. The investigation eventually led to the discovery of hundreds of domains associated with these name servers, tens of which were hosted on dedicated servers.
The researchers note these are suspicious domains but note that “consistencies in registration and hosting tactics do not definitively associate many of these suspicious domains with previous malicious, Fancy Bear activity.”
“It's important to caveat our confidence in these indicators' association to FANCY BEAR activity. For many of those indicators that we've included here, we don't know whether they have actually been used maliciously. But if known bad is all that you are worried about or interested in, then you'll always be at least one step behind the attacker. Only by leveraging intelligence to identify and exploit our adversaries' tactics can we move from a reactive, whack-a-mole state to a proactive, informed defense,” ThreatConnect says.
Microsoft, in the meantime, is taking legal action against Fancy Bear: the tech company filed a civil lawsuit in August 2016, seeking to seize command-and-control (C&C) domains used by the group. According to court documentation Microsoft made public, there are hundreds of domains containing Microsoft trademarks that it is looking to take control of.
The actors failed to appear in a federal court in Virginia to defend themselves, and Microsoft is pushing for a default judgment in its favor. By seizing the domains, Microsoft would be able to cut the group off from communicating with infected systems.
“Microsoft seeks a preliminary injunction directing the registries associated with these Internet domains to take all steps necessary to disable access to and operation of these Internet domains to ensure that changes or access to the Internet domains cannot be made absent a court order and that all content and material associated with these Internet domains are to be isolated and preserved pending resolution of the dispute. Microsoft seeks a permanent injunction, other equitable relief and damages,” Microsoft notes.
Previously, Microsoft used legal action to take down botnets. In 2012, as part of Operation b71, the company seized C&C servers associated with the notorious Zeus family of malware. In 2014, in an attempt to take down the Bladabindi (njRAT) and Jenxcus (NJw0rm) malware families, the company seized 23 No-IP domains to route bad traffic to a sinkhole.

22,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Change Tactics in Recent Campaign

Recently observed attacks orchestrated by the Russian threat group Sofacy have revealed a change in tactics and new iterations of previously known tools, according to Palo Alto Networks researchers.
Also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Strontium, the cyber-espionage group has been associated with numerous attacks worldwide, including those targeting the 2016 presidential election in the United States, assaults on Ukraine and NATO countries, and attacks on targets in Asia.
Earlier this year, security researchers revealed that Sofacy’s campaigns overlap with other state-sponsored operations, and also dissected a new backdoor employed by the group. Dubbed Zebrocy, the new malware consists of a Delphi downloader and an AutoIT stage, ESET reported in April.
Now, Palo Alto reveals that a C++ version of Zebrocy has also been seen in attacks. Furthermore, the security researchers discovered Sofacy attacks that leveraged the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit technique to deliver different payloads than before.
The campaign, Palo Alto says, breaks out of the previously observed patterns in that it no longer targets only a handful of employees within a single organization. Instead, the attackers sent phishing emails to “an exponentially larger number of individuals” within the target company.
“The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines. This is a stark contrast with other attacks commonly associated with the Sofacy group,” the security researchers explain.
Not only did the group launch a large number of Zebrocy attacks, but it also started using DDE to deliver payloads such as the Zebrocy backdoor and the open-source penetration testing toolkit Koadic (this is the first time it leverages this tool). Previously, the group used the DDE technique for the distribution of Seduploader.
As detailed in a February report, Palo Alto also discovered that the group was hiding infrastructure using random registrant and service provider information for each attack and that they deployed a webpage on each of the domains.
The artifact led to the discovery of an attack campaign using the DealersChoice exploit kit, as well as another domain serving the Zebrocy AutoIT downloader.
Eventually, this led to the discovery of the C++ variant of the Zebrocy downloader tool, as well as to “evidence of a completely different payload in Koadic being delivered as well.” The Delphi backdoor delivered as the final payload in Zebrocy attacks was found hosted at IP address 185.25.50[.]93, the researchers say.
From this command and control (C&C) IP, the researchers discovered another hard-coded user agent being used by Zebrocy. Several samples of the backdoor employing the user agent were observed targeting the foreign affairs ministry of a large Central Asian nation.
One other sample used a different user agent, which the researchers determined was from a secondary payload retrieved by the malware. The researchers eventually discovered over forty additional Zebrocy samples, several of which were targeting the same Central Asian nation.
Two weaponized Office documents leveraging DDE were used to target a North American government organization dealing with foreign affairs with the Zebrocy AutoIT downloader, and the previously mentioned large Central Asian nation, but with a non-Zebrocy payload this time, namely Koadic.
“Sofacy is carrying out parallel campaigns to attack similar targets around the world but with different toolsets. The Zebrocy tool associated with this current strain of attacks is constructed in several different forms based on the programming language the developer chose to create the tool. We have observed Delphi, AutoIt, and C++ variants of Zebrocy, all of which are related not only in their functionality, but also at times by chaining the variants together in a single attack,” Palo Alto concludes.

23,APT28,"DHS Uses Cyber Kill Chain to Analyze Russia-Linked Election Hacks

DHS Publishes Enhanced Analysis Report on GRIZZLY STEPPE Activity
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) on Friday published a new report providing additional indicators of compromise (IOC) and analysis using the cyber kill chain to detect and mitigate threats from the Russia-linked ""GRIZZLY STEPPE"" hackers.
On Dec. 29, 2016, the DHS and FBI published an initial Joint Analysis Report (JAR) detailing the tools and infrastructure used by Russian hackers designated by DHS as “GRIZZLY STEPPE” in attacks against the United States election. The previous report, however, didn’t deliver on its promise, security experts argued.
While the original report included a series of IOCs, some said that they were of low quality, had limited utility to defenders, and were published as a political tool attempting to connect the attacks to Russia.
The new report is described by DHS as an Analytical Report (AR) providing a “thorough analysis of the methods threat actors use to infiltrate systems” in relation to the GRIZZLY STEPPE hackers. The report provides additional details on IOCs, along with analysis along phases of the cyber kill chain, and suggests specific mitigation techniques that could be used to counter GRIZZLY STEPPE attackers.
Utilizing the Cyber Kill Chain to Analyze GRIZZLY STEPPE
DHS analysts leveraged the Cyber Kill Chain framework created by Lockheed Martin that describes the phases of an attack. The report summarizes the activity of the campaign using each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, which are Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and Actions on the Objective.

The report also provides detailed host and network signatures to help defenders detect and mitigate GRIZZLY STEPPE related activity, including additional YARA rules and IOCs associated with the attacks.
The DHS has previously said that two different actors participated in the political attacks, one in the summer of 2015, namely APT29, and the other in spring 2016, namely APT28. The former is also known as Cozy Bear, or CozyDuke, while the latter is referred to as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team.
DHS recommends that security teams read multiple bodies of work from various sources concerning GRIZZLY STEPPE.
“While DHS does not endorse any particular company or their findings, we believe the breadth of literature created by multiple sources enhances the overall understanding of the threat. DHS encourages analysts to review these resources to determine the level of threat posed to their local network environments,” the agency said.",https://www.securityweek.com/dhs-uses-cyber-kill-chain-analyze-russia-linked-election-hacks
24,APT28,"Russia-linked Hackers Directly Targeting Diplomats: Report

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group Sofacy has been targeting foreign affairs agencies and ministries worldwide in a recently discovered campaign, Palo Alto Networks warns.
The hacking group, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Tsar Team, and Strontium, has been highly active recently, and new evidence shows activity directly targeting diplomats in North America and Europe, including those at a European embassy in Moscow.
Sofacy was supposedly behind the attacks on the 2016 United States presidential election, but also hit Ukraine and NATO countries. In fact, the group heavily targeted NATO in early 2017, when it even used zero-day exploits, but then started to shift its focus towards the Middle East and Central Asia.
Palo Alto Networks has now uncovered two parallel efforts within a new Sofacy campaign, each using its own set of tools for attacks. One of the efforts was observed in the beginning of February 2018 to use phishing emails as the attack vector, to target an organization in Europe and another in North America.
The message spoofed the sender address of Jane’s by IHSMarkit, a well-known supplier of information and analysis. The email carried an attachment claiming to be a calendar of events relevant to the targeted organizations, but was a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious macro script.
The attackers used a white font color to hide the content of the document to the victim and lure them into enabling macros. Once that happens, the script changes the text color to black.
The macro also retrieves content from several cells to obtain a base64 encoded payload, writes it to a text file in the ProgramData folder, and leverages the command certutil -decode to decode the contents to an .exe file, which it runs after two seconds.
The executable is a loader Trojan that decrypts an embedded payload (DLL) and saves it to a file. Next, it creates a batch file to run the DLL payload, and writes the path to the batch file to a registry key, for persistence.
The installed malware is a variant of SofacyCarberp, which has been extensively used by the threat group in attacks. The malware performs initial reconnaissance by gathering system information, then sends the data to the command and control (C&C) server and fetches additional tools.
Both the loader and the SofacyCarberp variant used in the attack are similar to samples previously analyzed, yet they include several differences, such as a new hashing algorithm to resolve API functions and find browser processes for injection, and modified C&C communication mechanisms.
The security researchers also believe the group may have used the Luckystrike open-source tool to generate the malicious document and/or the macro, as the macro in the document closely resembles those found within the Microsoft PowerShell-based tool. The only difference between the two, besides random function name and random cell values, would be the path to the “.txt” and “.exe” files.
The security researchers also noticed that the Sofacy group registered new domains as part of the campaign, but that it used a default landing page they employed in other attacks as well. The domain used in this attack, cdnverify[.]net was registered on January 30, 2018.
 
“No other parts of the C&C infrastructure amongst these domains contained any overlapping artifacts. Instead, the actual content within the body of the websites was an exact match in each instance,” Palo Alto notes.
“The Sofacy group should no longer be an unfamiliar threat at this stage. They have been well documented and well researched with much of their attack methodologies exposed. They continue to be persistent in their attack campaigns and continue to use similar tooling as in the past. This leads us to believe that their attack attempts are likely still succeeding, even with the wealth of threat intelligence available in the public domain,” Palo Alto concludes.

25,APT28,"Russian Hackers Favor Windows, Office Exploits: Report

Adobe’s Flash Player might be the most targeted product when criminal exploit kits are involved, but Microsoft products such as Office, Windows and Internet Explorer take center stage when Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are involved.
According to a new report from Recorded Future, 55% of vulnerabilities exploited by these groups are targeting versions of Office, Windows and Internet Explorer. State-sponsored actors have been focusing on widely adopted software, and only 46% of the known Russian APT exploited vulnerabilities can be also found in exploit kits used by cyber criminals.
Dubbed “Running for Office: Russian APT Toolkits Revealed,” Recorded Future’s report also reveals that there might be no connection between APT28 and APT29, two of the most active actors. The former, which is also known as Fancy Bear, Operation Pawn Storm, Sednit, and Sofacy, is associated by many with Russian military intelligence (GRU), while the latter, also called Cozy Bear, The Dukes, and Office Monkeys, is possibly associated with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).
Of the 33 known exploited product vulnerabilities that various Russian APTs use to steal information, 27 are tied to APT28 (22) and APT29 (5), but they don’t overlap, although both were found to have compromised the Democratic National Committee (DNC) network. APT29 managed to infiltrate the network last year, while APT28 compromised it in April this year.
Alongside these two groups, the alleged Russian state-sponsored groups Energetic Bear (also known as Dragonfly, Group 24, Koala Team) and Turla (aka Snake, Ouroboros, Carbon) also regularly target Microsoft products, the report claims. The massive user bases these products enjoy make them targets of choice: Windows has over 1.5 billion users, while Office has over 1.2 billion.
In addition to Microsoft products, these groups also focus on exploiting vulnerable Adobe software, including Flash Player and Acrobat, Oracle products, such as Java, Mozilla applications, and community software. According to Recorded Future’s report, only 73% of vulnerabilities targeted by Russian APTs have public exploits available on portals such as Metasploit, Exploit Database and Github.
Some of these vulnerabilities include CVE-2015-1701 and CVE-2015-3043, both associated with APT28 last year, CVE-2015-7645, patched in October by Adobe, and CVE-2015-1641, currently one of the most popular Office flaws, alongside CVE-2015-2545. CVE-2012-0158, another highly abused vulnerability in Office, is also targeted by these groups.
Although these groups are still targeting vulnerabilities discovered seven or six years ago (such as CVE-2009-1123, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2010-4398) in Microsoft products, they don’t use flaws that have been reported this year. The only new exploit is CVE-2016-0728, used by APT28 to target Linux machines.
The attack tactics employed by these groups are similar to those used by other threat actors, such as spear-phishing, spoofed domains supporting credential phishing, social engineering and watering hole attacks. The security researchers claim that Office and Acrobat are popular targets among them because of attacks that use attachments in spear-phishing emails. Of the 33 analyzed vulnerabilities, 8 impact Office/Acrobat.
“Heavy Russian APT use of Office and Adobe PDF exploits may be in line with the more targeted nature of state-sponsored attacks. Criminal campaigns such as ransomware play a numbers game, while state-sponsored attacks focus on specific organizations and information,” the report reveals.
When looking at the 22 exploits used by APT28 and the 5 employed by APT29, researchers discovered that they are different, meaning that the two groups are not connected. Previous reports also suggested that the two groups do not coordinate or share resources and infrastructure. Although both actors infiltrated DNC, they did so by unwittingly stealing the same set of credentials, researchers say.

26,APT28,"Russian Hackers Infiltrated German Ministries' Network: Report

Berlin - Russian hackers have infiltrated Germany's foreign and interior ministries' online networks, German news agency DPA reported Wednesday quoting unnamed security sources.
The hacker group known as APT28 -- which has been linked to Russia's GRU military intelligence and accused of attacks on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign -- managed to plant malware in the ministries' networks for possibly as long as a year, the news agency said.
German security authorities only detected the online spying in December, it said, adding that an isolated government IT network had also been hit.
If confirmed, the attack would be the biggest to hit the German government.
Top security officials had repeatedly warned during Germany's 2017 general elections that Russia hackers may seek to disrupt the polls.
While authorities did not have concrete proof, they have pinned the malware attack that crippled the Bundestag parliamentary network in 2015 for days on the APT28, also known as ""Fancy Bear"" or ""Sofacy"".
The attack netted 17 gigabytes of data which, officials feared, could be used to blackmail MPs or discredit them.
Amid the rising frequency of attacks, Germany's defence ministry in 2016 set up a cyber department to coordinate a response to online intrusions.",https://www.securityweek.com/russian-hackers-infiltrated-german-ministries-network-report
27,APT28,"Pawn Storm Attackers Target MH17 Plane Crash Investigators

Organizations tasked with investigating the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 have been targeted by the Russia-linked threat group known as Pawn Storm, Trend Micro reported on Thursday.
Flight MH17, traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, crashed on July 17, 2014 after being hit by a Russian-made missile while flying over a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. The investigation into the incident was led by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB), which published a report on the crash of MH17 on October 13.
According to Trend Micro researchers, the Pawn Storm cyber espionage group (also known as Sednit, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Tsar Team) targeted the DSB both before and after the organization published its report on the incident.
“We believe that a coordinated attack from several sides was launched to get unauthorized access to sensitive material of the investigation conducted by Dutch, Malaysian, Australian, Belgian, and Ukrainian authorities,” researchers said.
The security firm discovered that the attackers set up fake Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and VPN servers designed to mimic servers of the Dutch Safety Board most likely in an effort to phish the credentials of the organization’s staff. The goal was to obtain credentials that they could use to access the legitimate SFTP and VPN servers.
Trend Micro says this is the first time it has found direct evidence that an APT actor has targeted a VPN server.
“The VPN server of the Safety Board looks to use temporary tokens for authentication. However, these tokens can be phished in a straightforward way and tokens alone do not protect against one-time unauthorized access by third parties, once the target falls for the phishing attack,” experts said.
In addition to the DSB, the attackers also targeted one of the organization’s key partners using a rogue Outlook Web Access (OWA) server, a technique previously used by Pawn Storm in attacks aimed at defense companies in the United States. The security company says it has warned the targeted entity in an early stage of the attack so the attempt was probably blocked.
Over the past couple of months, Pawn Storm has also taken an increased interest in Syrian opposition groups and Arab countries that object to Russia’s intervention in Syria. Trend Micro says the group has set up several fake OWA servers in an effort to target the military, the Foreign Affairs Ministries, and the Defense Ministries of these countries.
The Russia-linked threat actor’s activities made the news earlier this month after researchers discovered that they had been using an Adobe Flash Player zero-day to target Foreign Affairs Ministries.
Trend Micro also revealed this week that the group had used a Java zero-day patched by Oracle with the release of the October 2015 CPU in attacks aimed at the White House and NATO member countries.",https://www.securityweek.com/pawn-storm-attackers-target-mh17-plane-crash-investigators
28,APT28,"Fysbis Backdoor Preferred by Pawn Storm Group to Target Linux

Researchers at Palo Alto Networks have performed an in-depth analysis of Fysbis, the preferred Linux malware used by the Pawn Storm threat group. The simple, yet efficient tool is proving to be effective because Linux security in general is still a maturing area, the experts say.
Pawn Storm is a well-known cyber espionage group believed to have ties to the Russian government. Also known as Sofacy, APT28 and Sednit, the group has been around since 2007, targeting government, military, and defense organizations around the world, as well as various Eastern European governments.
Over the years, Pawn Storm has used a multitude of tools for its attack operations, such as zero-day exploits in Flash, Java or Microsoft Office, spear-phishing, and website compromise. Their tools target multiple operating systems, including Windows, OS X, Linux, and iOS, but Fysbis appears to be their malware of choice when it comes to infiltrating Linux systems.
The tool, a modular Linux Trojan / backdoor that implements plug-in and controller modules as distinct classes, is not sophisticated, Palo Alto’s Bryan Lee and Rob Downs explain in a blog post. The malware includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) binaries and can install itself onto a system with and without root privileges.
The researchers note that the lack of sophistication displayed by this malware suggests that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors don’t require advanced means to reach their objectives. They also note that, while these actors do own advanced malware and zero-day exploits, they often keep them in reserve and use the smallest amount of resources needed to meet their goals.
The Fysbis analysis revealed that the malware checks the Linux version during installation, and runs a series of shell commands to establish persistency. Recently, the group behind the malicious program improved their obfuscation technique, to ensure that the installation information is no longer leaked in the clear, as had been the case prior.
By looking at several malware samples, researchers discovered that, while some did beacon to domains previously known to be used for command and control (C&C) by the Pawn Storm group, others called back to new domains. The newly found C&C domain mozilla-plugins[.]com wasn’t previously associated with the group, nor was the IP address it resolves to.
Palo Alto Networks believes that the domain and IP are associated to a newer campaign, although the malware samples show similarities at the code level and in terms of shared behavior. What is clear, however, is that while other adversaries seem hesitant to change their infrastructure, Pawn Storm did invest in additional resources to do so, although some Fysbis samples displayed the same type of behavior.
According to Palo Alto Networks researchers, Fysbis has contributed to the success of associated attacks by the Pawn Storm / Sofacy group mainly because Linux security is missing key elements. They also note that expertise in the Linux platform is highly sought after across all industries, as the platform remains largely unknown even to enterprise IT specialists.
Linux is used across a broad variety of environments, including homes, cloud, and the majority of Internet-facing web and application servers, while also being the foundation of the Android mobile platform. However, it also poses a high risk to organizations’ security posture because Linux malware and vulnerabilities do exist and are in use by advanced adversaries, while detection and prevention is not prevalent at this time.

29,APT28,"Russian 'Fancy Bear' Hackers Abuse Blogspot for Phishing

The cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, which is widely believed to be backed by the Russian government, has been abusing Google’s Blogspot service in recent phishing attacks.
Threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect spotted the use of the blogging service while analyzing attacks aimed at Bellingcat, a group of investigative journalists that uses open source information to report on various events taking place around the world.
Fancy Bear, also known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, Strontium and Tsar Team, was first seen targeting Bellingcat in 2015 as part of a campaign aimed at entities investigating Russia’s involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July 2014 as it was crossing a conflict zone in Ukraine.
The latest attacks aimed at Bellingcat involved fake emails instructing users to change their Gmail passwords as a result of unauthorized activity on their account, and Dropbox invitations to view shared folders.
The buttons included in these emails pointed to a randomly generated Blogspot subdomain set up to redirect visitors to a phishing page. The phishing sites used HTTPS and they were hosted on subdomains that may have tricked many individuals into thinking they were legitimate. Experts believe the attackers likely used Blogspot in an effort to get past spam filters.
“A URL hosted on Google's own systems, in this case Blogspot, may be more likely to get past spam filters than URLs hosted on a third party IP address or hostname,” ThreatConnect researchers said in a blog post.
Fancy Bear is believed to be behind many high profile attacks, including a campaign that may have attempted to interfere in last year’s presidential election in the United States.
Researchers at SecureWorks reported last year that they had identified thousands of Gmail accounts targeted by the hackers. The security firm recently provided the entire list of accounts to The Associated Press, whose reporters have analyzed them in an effort to find who they belong to.
They identified the email addresses of entities in 116 countries, including former U.S. Secretaries of State John Kerry and Colin Powell, NATO Supreme Commanders Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove and Army Gen. Wesley Clark, defense contractors such as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, U.S. politicians and intelligence officials, Ukrainian officials and the pope’s representative in Kiev, and Russian opponents of the Kremlin.

30,APT28,"Google Tightens OAuth Rules to Combat Phishing

Following last week’s phishing attack against Gmail users, Google is planning tightened OAuth rules to prevent similar incidents from occurring.
Phishing emails, which impersonate a trusted source to trick the recipient into opening a malicious attachment or clicking a suspicious link, have long been a favorite tool for attackers. Google’s email service blocks millions of phishing emails each day, but last week’s incident proved that the system isn’t invincible.
The phishing attack tricked users into granting access to their contact information to a third-party application cleverly named “Google Docs.” The incident resulted in the attacker gaining access to all of the affected users’ email content, as well as in the phishing attack immediately propagating to all of the victim’s contacts.
The phishing emails, which appeared to arrive from someone in the victim’s contact list, claimed to contain a link to Google Docs content that the sender wanted to share with the recipient. Once the user clicked on the link, they were taken to a legitimate Google sign-in page, where they were asked to authorize an app called “Google Docs,” thus allowing it to read, send, delete, and manage emails and contacts.
Google was able to spot and block the attack fast, but the incident meant that immediate actions that users might have taken, such as changing passwords, had no effect. Because OAuth was used, the attackers still had access to the account, and only removing permissions for the offending app could solve the issue.
“We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again,” Google said after the incident.
Now, the company reveals that it is updating its policies and enforcement on OAuth applications to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future. Moreover, updates to Google’s anti-spam systems should help prevent similar campaigns, and augmented monitoring of suspicious third-party apps that request information from users should add an extra layer of security.
“We’re committed to keeping your Google Account safe, and have layers of defense in place to guard against sophisticated attacks of all types, from anti-hijacking systems detecting unusual behavior, to machine learning models that block malicious content, to protection measures in Chrome and through Safe Browsing that guard against visiting suspicious sites,” Google says.
What should be noted is that the concept of launching such an attack isn’t new. It was first presented in 2011 by André DeMarre, and then thoroughly detailed by Greg Carson in February 2017.
In fact, the cyber espionage group known as Pawn Storm (aka Fancy Bear, APT28) was observed using the very same technique in the past. Trend Micro recently revealed that this actor’s phishing scheme employed an application dubbed Google Defender, while abusing “the same legitimate OAuth connection to exploit the user’s lack of knowledge of available services.”
In an emailed statement to SecurityWeek, Jaime Blasco, Chief Scientist at AlienVault, shared a similar point of view: “This is similar to what APT28 (the group behind the DNS hack, France election groups attacks, etc) was using a while back. I don't believe they are behind this though because this is way too widespread. Many people/organizations have received similar attempts so this is probably something massive and less targeted.”
According to Google, less than 0.1% of Gmail users were impacted by last week’s “Google Docs” incident, but, as Talos’ Sean Baird and Nick Biasini point out, this proof-of-concept did reveal that a convincing Google phish via OAuth is possible.
To further protect users from such attacks, Google also announced anti-phishing security checks for Gmail for Android. Thus, users will be warned when clicking on suspicious links they receive via email, which should help prevent them from disclosing financial and personal information.

31,APT28,"Sofacy Targets European Govt as U.S. Accuses Russia of Hacking

Just as the U.S. had been preparing to accuse Russia of launching cyberattacks against its energy and other critical infrastructure sectors, the notorious Russia-linked threat group known as Sofacy was spotted targeting a government agency in Europe.
The United States on Thursday announced sanctions against Russian spy agencies and more than a dozen individuals for trying to influence the 2016 presidential election and launching cyberattacks, including the destructive NotPetya campaign and operations targeting energy firms.
The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a joint technical alert via US-CERT last year to warn about attacks launched by a group known as Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear on critical infrastructure. Researchers previously linked Dragonfly to the Russian government and now the DHS has officially stated the same.
US-CERT has updated its alert with some additional information. The new version of the alert replaces “APT actors” with “Russian government cyber actors.” The DHS said that based on its analysis of malware and indicators of compromise, Dragonfly attacks are ongoing, with threat actors “actively pursuing their ultimate objectives over a long-term campaign.”
This is not the first time the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia over its attempt to influence elections. Russia has also been accused by Washington and others of launching the NotPetya attack last year. The Kremlin has always denied the accusations, but President Vladimir Putin did admit at one point that patriotic hackers could be behind the attacks.
If Dragonfly and Sofacy (aka Fancy Bear, APT28, Sednit, Tsar Team and Pawn Storm) are truly operating out of Russia, they don’t seem to be discouraged by sanctions and accusations.
On March 12 and March 14, security firm Palo Alto Networks spotted attacks launched by Sofacy against an unnamed European government agency using an updated variant of a known tool.
Sofacy has been using a Flash Player exploit platform dubbed DealersChoice since at least 2016 and it has continued improving it. The latest version has been delivered to a government organization in Europe using a spear phishing email referencing the “Underwater Defence & Security” conference, which will take place in the U.K. later this month.
What makes the new version of DealersChoice interesting, according to Palo Alto Networks, is the fact that it employs a clever evasion technique that has not been seen in the past.
Older versions of DealersChoice loaded a malicious Flash object as soon as the bait document was opened. The latest samples, however, include the Flash object on page three of the document and it’s only loaded if users scroll down to it. This Flash object, displayed in the document as a tiny black box, contacts the command and control (C&C) server to download an additional Flash object that contains the actual exploit.

Kaspersky reported last week that it had seen overlaps between attacks launched by Sofacy and campaigns conducted by other state-sponsored cyberspies, including ones linked to China and the United States.",https://www.securityweek.com/sofacy-targets-european-govt-us-accuses-russia-hacking
32,APT28,"Evidence Links Russia to Second Democratic Party Hack

Researchers from two security firms have uncovered evidence linking a Russian threat actor to the cyberattack targeting the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).
The DCCC is the second Democratic Party committee targeted by hackers over the past months. The first was the Democratic National Committee (DNC) which, according to several security companies, was targeted by two different Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actors: Cozy Bear, also known as Cozy Duke and APT29; and Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit.
SecureWorks reported last month that Fancy Bear had targeted thousands of Google accounts, including ones belonging to people working for or associated with the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
WikiLeaks later published a large number of emails obtained by hackers from the systems of the DNC. The Democratic Party blamed Russia for the intrusion, claiming that it was trying to help Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has publicly challenged Russia to hack into Clinton’s emails. Russia denied any involvement and claimed it had detected espionage attempts aimed at roughly two dozen of its government and military organizations.
Democratic Party officials revealed last week that the DCCC had also been breached in an attack similar to the one targeting the DNC, and researchers claim to have found evidence linking the attack to the Fancy Bear group.
Experts from Fidelis Cybersecurity and ThreatConnect analyzed secure.actblues[.]com, a domain designed to spoof secure.actblue[.]com, the ActBlue website that handles donations for the DCCC. The actblues[.]com domain appears to have been used in the DCCC attack, but researchers have not been able to determined if it was leveraged for social engineering, phishing or to deliver malware.
The security firms discovered that the email address used to register the actblues domain, [email protected][.]com, had been previously used to register three other domains linked to Fancy Bear. Furthermore, two name servers utilized by this email address to register suspicious domains have been tied to a fake domain leveraged in the DNC breach.
The timing of the fake ActBlue domain’s registration also indicates a link to the DNC hack. Experts determined that the domain was registered on June 14, the day CrowdStrike published its initial report on the DNC breach.
“This suggests that, after being outed, FANCY BEAR actors shifted their operation immediately to another target that might allow them to continue collection against Democratic figures involved in the U.S. election,” researchers said.
Experts also analyzed the company whose name servers have been used to register the fake ActBlue domain. The firm, called I.T. Itch, claims to provide anonymous web and Bitcoin hosting, and private domain registration services. I.T. Itch says it ignores all data requests and takedown notices, which makes it ideal for malicious operations. Researchers have identified numerous domains that use Itch services and appear to be related to APT activity.
Fidelis and ThreatConnect expect the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 to come forward and take responsibility for the DCCC attack. Guccifer 2.0, who has taken credit for the DNC hack, has claimed to be a Romanian with no connection to the Russian government, but his interviews with the media suggest that he does not speak Romanian well, leading many to believe that this persona is used by Russia to throw investigators off track.

33,APT28,"Hackers Leak Olympic Committee Emails in Response to Russia Ban

A group of hackers linked to Russia has leaked several emails apparently exchanged between officials of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other individuals involved with the Olympics. The leak comes in response to Russia being banned from the upcoming Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Games in South Korea.
The group, calling itself Fancy Bears and claiming to be a team of hacktivists that “stand for fair play and clean sport,” previously released confidential athlete medical records stolen from the systems of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and also targeted the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). One of their most recent leaks included emails and medical records related to football (soccer) players who used illegal substances.
The first leaks from Fancy Bears came shortly after Russian athletes were banned from the 2016 Rio Olympics following reports that Russia had been operating a state-sponsored doping program.
While Fancy Bears claim to be hacktivists, researchers have found ties between the group and Fancy Bear, a sophisticated Russian cyber espionage team also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, Tsar Team and Strontium.
The latest leak includes emails apparently exchanged between IOC officials and other individuals involved with the Olympics. Some of the messages discuss the recent decision to ban Russia from the upcoming Winter Games based on the findings of the IOC Disciplinary Commission.
“These emails and documents point to the fact that the Europeans and the Anglo-Saxons are fighting for power and cash in the sports world. WADA headquartered in Montreal, Canada supported by the United States Olympic Committee declared the crusade against the IOC on the pretext of defending clean sport,” the hackers said. “However, the genuine intentions of the coalition headed by the Anglo-Saxons are much less noble than a war against doping. It is apparent that the Americans and the Canadians are eager to remove the Europeans from the leadership in the Olympic movement and to achieve political dominance of the English-speaking nations.”
While the hackers claim the emails they leaked prove the accusations, a majority of the messages don’t appear to contain anything critical. Furthermore, Olympics-related organizations whose systems were previously breached by the hackers claimed at the time that some of the leaked files had been doctored.
WADA representatives told Wired that Fancy Bears are looking to “undermine the work of WADA and others,” and claimed that everything they leaked this week is “dated.” WADA officially accused Russia of being behind previous attacks. 
It’s unclear how the emails have been obtained by the hackers, but the group has been known to launch phishing attacks involving fake WADA domains. It’s possible that they tricked some of the individuals whose emails have been compromised into handing over their credentials on a phishing site.
Russia has been accused by several experts of disguising some of its cyber campaigns as hacktivism. For instance, a hacker using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 has taken credit for an attack on the U.S. Democratic Party, which may have influenced last year’s presidential election.
Many believe the Fancy Bears attacks are Russia’s response to its athletes being banned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, articles from two major pro-Russia English-language news organizations suggest that the latest leak from Fancy Bears shows that Russia’s exclusion from the Olympics was politically motivated.
Security firm McAfee reported last week that several organizations associated with the Olympics had received emails set up to deliver information-stealing malware, but it’s unclear who is behind the attacks.

34,APT28,"Attack on Olympics Anti-Doping Agency Linked to Russia

Recent cyberattacks targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) have been linked by researchers to the notorious Russian threat actor known as Fancy Bear.
WADA, a non-profit organization initiated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and supported by national governments, is tasked with promoting, coordinating and monitoring the fight against drugs in sports.
The organization warned stakeholders earlier this month that malicious actors had registered two fake WADA domains, Wada-awa.[org] and Wada-arna.[org], and leveraged them for phishing attacks designed to trick users into handing over their credentials for the Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS). One of the users who fell for the scam was Yuliya Stepanova, a whistleblower who exposed widespread doping in Russian athletics.
Following the exposure of a Russian state-sponsored doping program, many Russian competitors were banned from the Olympics and the country’s entire team was suspended from the upcoming Paralympics.
Russia’s interest in the WADA seems to back the findings of threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect, which uncovered evidence that a threat actor believed to be sponsored by the Russian government is behind the attacks.
An analysis of the fake WADA domains revealed that they were likely registered by the group known as Fancy Bear, APT28, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team. ThreatConnect’s investigation showed that the attackers also registered tas-cass.[org], which typosquats the official domain of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
“We assess that the phishing and Stepanova’s compromise most likely are part of targeted activity by Russian actors in response to the whistleblower and the WADA’s recommendation to ban all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,” researchers explained. “Successful operations against these individuals and organizations could facilitate Russian efforts to privately or publically intimidate them or other potential whistleblowers.”
At around the same time as the WADA phishing attempts, a group calling itself Anonymous Poland leaked files allegedly stolen from the systems of WADA and CAS. While they haven’t found any definitive proof, circumstantial evidence suggests that these attacks could also be the work of a Russian group that used the Anonymous brand to throw investigators off track.
Researchers also blamed Fancy Bear for the recent attacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). A hacker using the online moniker Guccifer 2.0 has taken credit for both attacks and leaked numerous documents to prove it. However, experts believe Guccifer 2.0 is just a “Russian propaganda effort,” not an independent hacker from Romania, as he claims to be.

35,APT28,"Putin: Patriotic Russians Could Be Behind Election Hacks

Russian President Vladimir Putin says patriotic citizens may have launched politically motivated cyberattacks against foreign countries, but denied any government involvement in such operations.
Following accusations that Russian state-sponsored hackers interfered with the recent elections in the United States, Putin was asked on Thursday at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg about the possibility of Russian hackers influencing the upcoming elections in Germany. Putin responded by comparing hackers to artists.
“If artists get up in the morning feeling good, all they do all day is paint,” Putin said. “The same goes for hackers. They got up today and read that something is going on internationally. If they are feeling patriotic they will start contributing, as they believe, to the justified fight against those speaking ill of Russia.”
The Russian president noted that while this is possible in theory, his country does not engage in such activities on a government level. Putin also highlighted that threat actors could launch attacks and make it look like the source was Russia – a task that he described as “very easy.”
On the other hand, Putin said he was convinced that hackers cannot have a real impact on an election campaign.
“We do not engage in this activity at the government level and are not going to engage in it. On the contrary, we try to prevent this from happening in our country,” he said. “At any rate, I believe that no hackers can affect the election campaign in any European country, nor in Asia or in America.”
The United States has officially accused Russia of attempting to interfere with recent elections and an investigation has been launched to assess the impact of the cyberattacks on their outcome.
Thomas Rid, a professor in the department of War Studies at King's College London, believes the comments made by Putin are strategic.

Russian hackers are also believed to have targeted the political campaign of French President Emmanuel Macron. The attacks were uncovered by security firms, but the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) also claimed to have warned France of the attacks.
The threat groups tracked as Fancy Bear (aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit and STRONTIUM) and Cozy Bear (aka APT29, Office Monkeys and Cozy Duke) are widely believed to be associated with Russia. While many security firms refrain from making statements on attribution or simply point out that the hackers speak Russian, some companies have gone as far as to link them to Russian government agencies, such as the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the military intelligence agency GRU.

36,APT28,"Cyberspies Ramped Up Attacks After Exposure of Zero-Days

The Russia-linked threat actor known as Pawn Storm ramped up its attacks against governments and embassies after seeing that researchers discovered the Windows and Flash Player zero-day exploits it had been using.
In late October, Google disclosed a serious Windows kernel vulnerability that had been exploited in the wild. Microsoft was informed about the issue on October 21, but it only managed to release a patch this week. Microsoft was unhappy with Google’s decision, but it quickly provided some mitigations.
Microsoft revealed in early November that the Pawn Storm group, which it calls Strontium, exploited the Windows flaw (CVE-2016-7255) in combination with a Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2016-7855). Google also reported the Flash Player bug to Adobe on October 21, but unlike Microsoft, Adobe released a patch after only a few days.
Trend Micro has been monitoring Pawn Storm, which is also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team. According to the security firm, Pawn Storm initially used the two zero-days only against very high-profile targets.
Then, after the existence of the flaws was disclosed and Adobe released patches, the threat actor sent several waves of spear-phishing emails to embassies and other government agencies. Starting with early November, the cyberspies used the zero-days in attacks aimed at various governments around the world.
The vulnerabilities have been used against an increasing number of targets, which suggests that they started losing their value following Google’s disclosure.
Trend Micro spotted several types of spear-phishing emails used in these attacks. Some of them appeared to advertise Defence IQ’s Cyber Threat Intelligence and Incident Response conference. The emails carried specially crafted RTF documents that included a malicious Flash file designed to download an exploit for CVE-2016-7855.
Another attack involved emails with the subject line “European Parliament statement on nuclear threats.” These fake messages purported to come from the European Union’s media relations office and they included links that led to Pawn Storm’s exploit kit.

37,APT28,"Adobe Patch Tuesday Updates Fix Only One Flash Player Flaw

Adobe’s Patch Tuesday updates for January 2018 resolve only an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Flash Player.
The flaw is tracked as CVE-2018-4871, it has been classified as “important,” and it has been assigned a priority rating of 2, which means it’s unlikely to be exploited in malicious attacks any time soon.
The security hole has been described as an out-of-bounds read issue that can lead to information exposure. It affects Flash Player 28.0.0.126 and earlier on Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS, and it has been patched with the release of version 28.0.0.137. The patch will also be included in the next Chrome release and Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday updates.
Adobe says it has learned about the vulnerability from an anonymous researcher via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
The number of vulnerabilities discovered by researchers in Flash Player has dropped significantly in the past months after Adobe announced its intention to kill the application by 2020.
However, malicious actors are still finding and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Flash. In October, shortly after Adobe announced that it had no Patch Tuesday updates, the company was forced to quickly release a fix for Flash Player after learning that a cyber espionage group from the Middle East had been leveraging a zero-day to deliver spyware.
The same vulnerability was later exploited by the Russia-linked group APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team) in attacks aimed at government organizations and aerospace companies. Fortunately, this was apparently the only Flash Player zero-day exploited in 2017.

38,APT28,"Adobe Patches Flash Zero-Day Exploited by Pawn Storm

Adobe has released Flash Player updates to address the zero-day vulnerability exploited by the Russia-linked Pawn Storm threat group in attacks aimed at Foreign Affairs Ministries.
Adobe initially planned on releasing a patch this week, but the company managed to roll out a fix sooner than anticipated. Flash Player 19.0.0.226 for Mac and Windows, and Flash Player 11.2.202.540 for Linux patch the vulnerability exploited in targeted attacks (CVE-2015-7645) and a couple of other type confusion flaws that could lead to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2015-7647, CVE-2015-7648).
Trend Micro threats analyst Peter Pi was credited by Adobe for finding and analyzing the zero-day exploited in the wild, while Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero was credited for analyzing the resolved issues.
Pawn Storm used the zero-day to target Foreign Affairs Ministries from across the world. The attackers lured victims to websites containing the Flash Player exploit using spear-phishing emails. Once the exploit was successful, a variant of the Sednit malware, which is often used by Pawn Storm, was dropped onto the victim’s machine.
The Pawn Storm cyber espionage group (also known APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Tsar Team) has been around since at least 2007. The threat actor has targeted numerous military, government, and defense organizations, including NATO members and the White House.
In a blog post detailing CVE-2015-7645, Pi noted that this is the first Flash Player zero-day exploited in the wild after Adobe introduced in July a series of mitigations. The mitigation techniques, developed in collaboration with Google Project Zero, are designed to prevent attacks leveraging “Vector/<*>” exploits.
The introduction of the mitigations led to a decrease in the number of attacks, but the latest incident has demonstrated that attackers haven’t given up.
While Adobe classifies CVE-2015-7645 as a type confusion vulnerability, Trend Micro’s Pi says this is a new type of flaw that the security firm calls “method confusion.” The weakness exists in the writeObject method of the ByteArray object.
“The [analyzed] sample overwrote the length field of a ByteArray-based object to 0Xfffffff6. [The attackers] used this to read and write into arbitrary memory locations. The Vector.<*> mitigations are of no use here as the ByteArray length is not protected,” Pi explained. “Attackers need not rely on targeting Vector.<*> for exploits in the future. As this attack has shown, there are other objects that can be used (or abused) by attackers. Adobe should protect the ByteArray length and other objects that have the length property.”",https://www.securityweek.com/adobe-patches-flash-zero-day-exploited-pawn-storm
39,APT28,"Hackers Target Czech Foreign Ministry's Email System

Prague - The Czech foreign minister said Tuesday his office had fallen prey to hackers who worked their way into the email accounts of dozens of employees including himself.
""Since early January we have known one of the attacks was partly successful as the hackers managed to penetrate the email system of the ministry,"" Lubomir Zaoralek told reporters.
He added however that no classified information was compromised as hackers failed to get into the ministry's inner system.
""The data leak was considerable. The attack was very sophisticated,"" Zaoralek said.
""It must have been carried out from the outside, by another country. The way it was done bears a very strong resemblance to the attacks on the US Democratic Party's internet system,"" said the foreign minister, citing experts.
In July 2016, the Democratic National Committee faced a leak of e-mails that Hillary Clinton's campaign blamed on Russia.
In early January, US intelligence said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a campaign of hacking and media manipulation aimed at undermining Clinton's presidential campaign and boosting Donald Trump.
Last October, Czech police arrested a Russian hacker in Prague in cooperation with the FBI and accused him of staging cyber attacks on the United States.
The hacker is in custody in the Czech Republic pending extradition to the United States or Russia as both countries have asked Prague to hand over the suspect.
In neighboring Poland, the Rzeczpospolita daily reported Monday that a group of Russian hackers called APT28 had tried to attack local foreign ministry servers in December through emails pretending to be sent by the NATO secretary general.
This group, also known as Pawn Storm, Sofacy and Fancy Bears, is believed to be behind other high-profile cyber attacks and to be linked to Russia's security services.",https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-target-czech-foreign-ministrys-email-system
40,APT28,"Windows Zero-Day Exploited in Attacks Aimed at Middle East

One of the vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft with its latest Patch Tuesday updates is a Windows zero-day exploited by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group in attacks aimed at entities in the Middle East.
The flaw, tracked as CVE-2018-8453, has been described by Microsoft as a privilege escalation issue related to how the Win32k component of Windows handles objects in memory. An authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability to take control of an affected system.
The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by Kaspersky Lab after one of the security firm's systems detected an exploitation attempt. Kaspersky said it had reported the vulnerability to Microsoft on August 17 – it's unclear why Microsoft waited so long to release a fix.
According to Kaspersky, CVE-2018-8453 has been exploited by an APT group it tracks as FruityArmor. The exploit was executed by a malware installer for obtaining the privileges needed to gain persistence on the targeted system.
The security firm said FruityArmor created a high quality and reliable exploit that would work on as many versions of Windows as possible, including Windows 10.
Kaspersky has described the vulnerability as a use-after-free bug that is similar to CVE-2017-0263, a flaw patched by Microsoft back in May 2017 after it had been exploited by the Russia-linked threat actor known as APT28, Sofacy and Fancy Bear.
Hackers packaged the CVE-2018-8453 exploit in a malware installer that requires system privileges to deploy its payload. The payload has been described as a ""sophisticated implant used by the attackers for persistent access to the victims' machines.""
Kaspersky has seen the exploit being used against less than a dozen targets located in the Middle East.
""So far, this campaign has been extremely targeted, affecting a very low number of victims in the Middle East region, probably persons of interest for the attackers. However, the victimology is not clear, especially with such a small number of victims involved,"" Kaspersky researchers explained.
The company determined that FruityArmor is likely behind these attacks after discovering a PowerShell backdoor that in the past was only used by this APT group. In addition, some of the command and control (C&C) domains used in the latest campaign were also involved in past FruityArmor operations.
A blog post published early on Wednesday by Kaspersky contains technical details on the vulnerability and how it has been exploited by FruityArmor.
This is not the first time Kaspersky has come across a zero-day vulnerability exploited by FruityArmor. The hackers also exploited a Windows zero-day back in 2016, which Microsoft patched in October 2016 after being alerted by Kaspersky. At the time, the victims were researchers, activists and government-related individuals in Thailand, Iran, Algeria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.
""We believe that although FruityArmor´s activity has been slowly increasing during the last two years, the extremely targeted nature of the attacks helps them fly below the radar,"" Kaspersky said.",https://www.securityweek.com/windows-zero-day-exploited-attacks-aimed-middle-east
41,APT28,"Hackers Leak More Confidential Athlete Data

The hacker group calling itself Fancy Bears has leaked another batch of athlete medical records stolen from the systems of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The organization has confirmed the leak and again blamed Russia for the attack on its systems.
Earlier this week, the Fancy Bears group, which claims to be affiliated with the Anonymous hacktivist movement, leaked the Rio Olympics test results and therapeutic use exemptions of several U.S. athletes who they accused of being unjustly allowed by the WADA to use banned substances. The list of affected athletes included gymnast Simone Biles, basketball player Elena Delle Donne, and tennis players Venus and Serena Williams, all of whom have denied any wrongdoing.
The hackers announced on Thursday a new round of leaks targeting a total of 25 athletes from the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Romania and Germany.
“The list of doping addicts includes not only the athletes of the top Olympic teams but also those who compete for other countries,” the hackers said in a statement accompanying the leak. “We'll keep on telling the world about doping in elite sports. Stay tuned for new leaks.”
WADA has confirmed that the leaked files are genuine and pointed out that the information was obtained after hackers accessed the organization’s Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) through compromised credentials obtained via email spear-phishing attacks.
WADA insists that the Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear, APT28, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, Tsar Team and Strontium is behind the cyberattack. The organization reached this conclusion based on information provided by law enforcement and the timing of the attack.
“Given this intelligence and advice [from law enforcement and IT security agencies], WADA has no doubt that these ongoing attacks are being carried out in retaliation against the Agency, and the global anti-doping system, because of our independent Pound and McLaren investigations that exposed state-sponsored doping in Russia,” said Olivier Niggli, director general of WADA. “We condemn this criminal activity and have asked the Russian Government to do everything in their power to make it stop.”
Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement, but officials have complained about the lack of transparency and accused WADA of favoring some countries.
News of the WADA hack emerged in August. At the time, threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect published a blog post detailing the connection between this attack and the Russian threat group APT28.
APT28 is also believed to be responsible for the recent attacks on the U.S. Democratic Party. A hacktivist using the online moniker Guccifer 2.0 took credit for the Democratic Party breach, and while he claims to be a lone wolf from Romania, experts believe it’s just a persona used by Russian intelligence to throw investigators off track.

42,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Accused of Attack on Olympics Anti-Doping Agency


Hackers Leak Athlete Medical Data From Olympics Anti-Doping Agency
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has officially pointed the finger at a Russian cyberespionage group for breaching its systems and leaking sensitive athlete data, including confidential medical records, but a hacktivist group has also taken credit for the attack.
WADA hacked via password phishing
WADA, a non-profit organization founded by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and supported by national governments, informed stakeholders last month that malicious actors had registered two fake WADA domains which they had leveraged to phish credentials for the Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS). Yuliya Stepanova, a whistleblower who exposed widespread doping in Russian athletics, was one of the victims of the attack.
Researchers quickly found connections between the attack on WADA and the notorious Russia-linked threat actor known as Fancy Bear, APT28, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Tsar Team and Sednit.
On Tuesday, WADA published a statement confirming that a Russian spy group was behind the attack on its systems. The organization doesn’t appear to have reached this conclusion on its own – it got the information from law enforcement authorities.
WADA said the hackers used phished credentials to access athlete data, including test results from the Rio Games and Therapeutic Use Exemptions, some of which they published online.
“WADA condemns these ongoing cyber-attacks that are being carried out in an attempt to undermine WADA and the global anti-doping system,” said Olivier Niggli, director general of WADA. “Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia further to the outcomes of the Agency’s independent McLaren Investigation Report.”
Russian espionage or hacktivism?
The group that leaked the athlete data is calling itself “Fancy Bears’ international hacking team” and its website, fancybear.net, suggests that it’s affiliated with the Anonymous hacktivist movement.
The hackers claim they have launched OpOlympics, a campaign whose goal is to show that famous athletes from the U.S. and other countries won medals at the Olympics by using substances banned by WADA. The group even accepts Bitcoin donations on its website.
The group has so far leaked test results and other medical documents on American athletes, including gymnast Simone Biles, basketball player Elena Delle Donne, and tennis players Venus and Serena Williams.
“After detailed studying of the hacked WADA databases we figured out that dozens of American athletes had tested positive,” the hackers said. “The Rio Olympic medalists regularly used illicit strong drugs justified by certificates of approval for therapeutic use. In other words they just got their licenses for doping. This is other evidence that WADA and IOC's Medical and Scientific Department are corrupt and deceitful.”
Biles and Donne reacted to the data leak on Twitter, claiming they had been taking the WADA-banned substances for genuine medical conditions. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) also published a statement backing the claims of the affected athletes.
“The athletes haven’t [done anything wrong],” said USADA CEO Travis T. Tygart. “In fact, in each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication. The respective International Federations, through the proper process, granted the permission and it was recognized by the IOC and USADA.”
Russia has denied any involvement in the attack on WADA. However, it’s worth noting that this is not the first time the country has been accused of a cyberattack for which “hacktivists” take credit.
When the U.S. Democratic Party’s systems were breached this summer, experts immediately pointed the finger at the APT28/Fancy Bear threat group, but a hacktivist using the online moniker “Guccifer 2.0” took credit for the attack. Now, evidence again seems to point at Russia and a hacktivist group calling itself “Fancy Bears’ Hacking Team” takes credit.
In the case of Guccifer 2.0, who has claimed to be Romanian, although he has failed to prove it, some researchers believe he is actually a personna used by cyberspies to throw investigators off track.

43,APT28,"State Election System Hacking Linked to Previous Attacks

Researchers have found links between the recent cyberattacks on U.S. state election systems and previous operations targeting political and government organizations in Turkey, Ukraine and Germany.
A flash alert issued by the FBI last month warned about a couple of attacks targeting board of election systems in two U.S. states. While the agency did not name the states, they are believed to be Illinois and Arizona, both of which shut down their voter registration systems this summer following cyberattacks.
The FBI’s report included a list of IP addresses and penetration testing tools used by the attackers in their operations.
Unnamed U.S. officials told the press that the attacks were conducted by Russia, just like the recent campaigns targeting the U.S. Democratic Party and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Researchers at threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect have analyzed the IP addresses disclosed by the FBI and determined that one of them was previously used in spear-phishing campaigns aimed at the Justice and Development (AK) Party in Turkey, the Freedom Party in Germany, and the Ukrainian Parliament.
The phishing campaigns, conducted between March and August 2016, leveraged an open source phishing framework named Phishing Frenzy. Researchers managed to access the attackers’ control panel and discovered a total of 113 emails written in Ukrainian, Turkish, German and English.
Of these emails, 48 were typical phishing emails targeting Gmail accounts, while the rest were specifically designed to capture the attention of the recipient by purporting to come from an affiliate or an organization of interest.
Some of the AK Party members targeted with the spear phishing emails also show up in the recent WikiLeaks dump of nearly 300,000 AK Party emails, but experts have not been able to determine if the two incidents are connected.
In addition to links to previous attacks, ThreatConnect discovered some connections to Russia and operations believed to be sponsored by the Russian government. One of the domains hosting the phishing pages was registered with an email address associated with a domain known to be used by the Russian threat actor Fancy Bear, aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team.
While researchers have not found any direct links to the Russian government or a known Russian state-sponsored actor, circumstantial evidence seems to point at Russia.
First of all, intelligence collected from the targeted organizations could be highly useful for Russia’s diplomatic relations and military efforts. As for more technical evidence, experts discovered that six of the eight IP addresses disclosed by the FBI belong to a Russian hosting service, and one of them had previously hosted a Russian cybercrime market.
Some of the IPs are owned by a company called FortUnix Networks. This firm’s infrastructure was also leveraged in BlackEnergy attacks targeting the Ukrainian power grid last year.
Another piece of evidence is related to the penetration testing tools described in the FBI flash alert. Some of the tools were previously used by Anonymous Poland, a group that recently leaked files from the anti-doping agency WADA. The attackers claim to be hacktivists, but researchers suspect they might be a creation of a Russian APT that wants to hide its tracks.

44,APT28,"FBI Attribution of 'VPNFilter' Attack Raises Questions

Information shared by the FBI on the massive VPNFilter attack in which more than half a million devices have been compromised raises some interesting questions about the connection between Russia-linked hacker groups.
The existence of VPNFilter was brought to light last week by Cisco Talos and several other cybersecurity firms. The botnet is powered by at least 500,000 hacked routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices across 54 countries.
The malware can intercept data passing through the compromised device, it can monitor the network for communications over the Modbus SCADA protocol, and also has destructive capabilities that can be leveraged to make an infected device unusable.
Many of the hijacked devices are located in Ukraine and a separate command and control (C&C) infrastructure has been set up for devices in this country. Researchers also spotted code similarities to the BlackEnergy malware and pointed out that there are only a few weeks until Ukraine celebrates its Constitution Day, which last year coincided with the destructive NotPetya attack. All this has led experts to believe that VPNFilter may mean Russia is preparing for a new attack on Ukraine.
Shortly after security firms published technical details on the attack, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that the FBI had seized toknowall.com, one of the C&C domains utilized by VPNFilter.
A press release and court documents name the Russia-linked threat actor Sofacy as being behind the attack. While this is not surprising, one noteworthy piece of information is that U.S. authorities say Sofacy is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sednit, X-Agent, and Sandworm.
Sandworm, also tracked by some security companies as TeleBots, is a threat actor known to use the BlackEnergy malware in attacks aimed at industrial systems and it’s believed to be responsible for the 2015 power outage in Ukraine. However, Sandworm was until now seen as a separate group from Sofacy.
SecurityWeek has reached out to the Justice Department and the FBI for clarifications, but the organizations say they “do not have a comment outside what is included in the DOJ press release.”
Industry professionals, however, have offered some possible explanations as to why the FBI may see Sofacy and Sandworm as the same group.
“Sandworm is a similar team whose interests overlap with APT 28. We believe these actors are related and act accordingly,” Craig Williams, director of outreach with Cisco Talos, told SecurityWeek.
Vikram Thakur, principal research manager at Symantec Security Response, noted, “The intelligence community has the best shot at attributing attacks to individuals and organizations. Every security vendor groups attackers based on their own vantage into the attack landscape.
“Keeping in mind that attack groups themselves share knowledge, expertise, and resources, we don’t have any reason to question the grouping of Sofacy, Sandworm, X-Agent, and others that the FBI listed in their affidavit to seize a domain related to VPNFilter.”
Researchers at Kaspersky also found it curious that the FBI suggested Sandworm and Sofacy were one and the same.
“This would suggest that Sandworm, also known as BlackEnergy APT, is regarded as subgroup of Sofacy by the FBI,” Kaspersky researchers said. “Most threat intel companies have held these groups separate before, although their activity is known to have overlapped in several cases.”
Advice from the FBI and targeted device vendors
Rebooting a router is typically enough to remove a piece of malware from the device. However, VPNFilter has some clever persistence mechanisms that help its stage 1 component survive a reboot.
An alert issued on Friday by the FBI advises owners of small office and home office routers to reboot their devices to “temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices.”
“Owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware,” the FBI said.
The VPNFilter malware has been observed targeting devices from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link and QNAP. All of these vendors have published advisories to warn their customers about the threat.
There is no evidence that the malware exploits any zero-day vulnerabilities to hack devices. Affected vendors noted that the flaws targeted by VPNFilter have already been patched and advised customers to update the firmware on their devices.

45,APT28,"More Evidence Links Russia to DNC Attack

Several security firms have found evidence that the recent attacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the U.S. Democratic Party, were launched by Russia-linked threat groups.
Threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike, which assisted the DNC’s investigation and cleanup efforts, reported last week that its incident response team uncovered evidence tying the attacks to two previously known advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
One of the groups is Russia-linked Cozy Bear, which is also known as CozyDuke and APT29. The actor is believed to have breached the DNC’s networks as far back as the summer of 2015 using an implant dubbed “SeaDaddy” and a PowerShell backdoor.
The second group, also believed to be operating from Russia, is Fancy Bear, aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team. The actor reportedly targeted the DNC in a separate attack in April 2016 using a piece of malware dubbed X-Agent and a network tunneling tool called X-Tunnel.
CrowdStrike said it did not see any evidence that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had been collaborating or that they had known about each other’s operation.
Shortly after the security firm made its findings public, a hacker using the online moniker “Guccifer 2.0” took credit for the attack and started leaking documents stolen from the DNC. The hacker mocked CrowdStrike for reporting that the attack was carried out by sophisticated groups and claimed that it was “very easy” for him to breach the organization’s systems.
“Guccifer” is the nickname first used by 44-year-old Romanian national Marcel Lazar Lehel, who has been extradited to the United States after hacking the online accounts of several celebrities and politicians, including the email server used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Guccifer 2.0 has set up a WordPress website and a Twitter account, which he has been using to release documents allegedly stolen from the DNC. On Monday, he threatened to leak a “dossier on Hillary Clinton” taken from DNC servers.
However, CrowdStrike is not the only security firm to point the finger at Russian government-backed actors for the attack on the DNC. Fidelis has conducted an independent investigation of the malware leveraged by hackers and confirmed CrowdStrike’s findings.
“Based on our comparative analysis we agree with CrowdStrike and believe that the COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR APT groups were involved in successful intrusions at the DNC. The malware samples contain data and programing elements that are similar to malware that we have encountered in past incident response investigations and are linked to similar threat actors,” Fidelis said.
ThreatConnect has analyzed one of the domains used by attackers for command and control (C&C) and discovered additional links to Fancy Bear.
In March, the SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU), which tracks Fancy Bear as Threat Group-4127 (TG-4127), observed a spear-phishing campaign that leveraged Bit.ly shortened links to target email accounts connected to the upcoming presidential election in the United States, including accounts belonging to individuals working for or associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC.
“CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network,” SecureWorks researchers said.
An analysis of the documents leaked by Guccifer has shown that the individual might be based in Russia, and experts have pointed out several reasons why Russia could benefit from the hack.
While it’s possible that Guccifer 2.0 has nothing to do with the cyberspy groups, experts believe the persona might have been set up by Russian intelligence in an effort to throw investigators off track. CrowdStrike said it stands by its analysis and findings.
“Whether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’ authenticity and origin. Regardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community,” the company said.",https://www.securityweek.com/more-evidence-links-russia-dnc-attack
46,APT28,"UK, Australia Blame Russia for Bad Rabbit, Other Attacks

The United Kingdom and Australia have officially blamed Russia for several high profile attacks, including the Bad Rabbit ransomware campaign.
A statement published by the U.K. government on Wednesday reveals that the country’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has linked several cyber threat actors to Russia’s GRU military intelligence service.
The NSCS believes that the GRU is behind the groups tracked by various security firms as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, Cyber Caliphate, Cyber Berkut, BlackEnergy, Voodoo Bear, Strontium, Tsar Team and Sandworm. While many of these names represent the same threat actor, the line between the operations carried out by various Russian groups often gets blurred, as shown by the recent VPNFilter attack.
The NCSC says that the GRU is “almost certainly” responsible for the Bad Rabbit ransomware attack in October 2017, the August 2017 attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the 2016 attack on the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC), and an attack on a small TV station in the UK in the summer of 2015. It’s worth noting that the U.S. has previously accused Russia of election-related hacks and even charged 12 intelligence officers.
“The GRU’s actions are reckless and indiscriminate: they try to undermine and interfere in elections in other countries; they are even prepared to damage Russian companies and Russian citizens. This pattern of behaviour demonstrates their desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences,” said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. “Our message is clear: together with our allies, we will expose and respond to the GRU’s attempts to undermine international stability.”
The Australian government has accused Russia’s GRU for the same attacks, but admitted that Australia itself was not significantly impacted by any of the campaigns.
“Cyberspace is not the Wild West. The International Community – including Russia – has agreed that international law and norms of responsible state behaviour apply in cyberspace. By embarking on a pattern of malicious cyber behaviour, Russia has shown a total disregard for the agreements it helped to negotiate,” reads a statement from Australia’s prime minister and minister of foreign affairs.
Australia says there must be consequences for these types of actions and public attribution is only the first step.
“It is unprecedented that the government should so overtly point the finger directly at the GRU. They must be very confident of their facts, either due to some sort of technical ‘fingerprint’ in the attack vectors themselves, or perhaps through corroboration from various other intelligence sources,” Malcolm Taylor, Director Cyber Advisory at ITC Secure and a former senior British intelligence officer, told SecurityWeek.
“But I think it’s also important to consider who benefits from attacks against these specific targets - WADA, Ukraine and the West in general. The answer to that question of course includes, and may indeed be limited to, Russia and Russian foreign policy interests. The mention of western businesses as targets should also be a reminder that foreign intelligence services do engage in commercial cyber espionage and we all need to take appropriate steps to manage that risk,” Taylor added.

47,APT28,"Experts Doubt Russia Used Malware to Track Ukrainian Troops

Experts have cast doubt on a recent report claiming that hackers linked to a Russian military intelligence agency used a piece of Android malware to track Ukrainian artillery units.
A report published by threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike before Christmas revealed that the Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear (aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit) modified a legitimate Android app used by the Ukrainian military.
Specifically, researchers found an Android version of X-Agent, a piece of malware known to be used by Fancy Bear, embedded in an app developed by artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk to help military personnel reduce the time to fire D-30 howitzers.
According to CrowdStrike, the malicious app, which had been distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016, was capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data. The security firm believes these capabilities could have allowed Russia to track Ukrainian troops via the app.
CrowdStrike also pointed to a report claiming that Ukraine had lost many D-30 guns in the past years, and speculated that this cyber operation may have contributed to those losses. Based on its investigation, the company is confident that Fancy Bear is connected to the Russian military, particularly the GRU foreign military intelligence agency.
Sherstuk has called CrowdStrike’s report “delusional” and pointed out that the app is not open source. He says the application has been under his control and he personally oversees the activation of each installation.
Jeffrey Carr, CEO of Taia Global and founder of the Suits and Spooks conference, has analyzed CrowdStrike’s report and, after contacting several other experts, he determined that the security firm’s arguments are flawed.
According to Carr, while X-Agent may be used by Fancy Bear, the malware is not exclusive to the group. The X-Agent source code appears to have been obtained by several entities, including Ukrainian hacktivist Sean Townsend and the security firm ESET.
The X-Agent variant found in the Ukraine military app has also been analyzed by Crysys, the Hungary-based security firm that has investigated several sophisticated pieces of malware, including Duqu. Researchers have found similarities between X-Agent implants described in previous Fancy Bear reports and the version found in the Ukrainian military app, but they pointed out that such similarities can be faked by threat actors.
Another interesting discovery is that the rogue app does not use GPS to obtain the infected device’s exact location, which Carr names “a surprising design flaw for custom-made malware whose alleged objective was to collect and transmit location data on Ukrainian artillery to the GRU.”
While the malware can collect some location data via the base stations used by the infected Android device, Carr believes it’s not enough to track someone, especially given Ukraine’s poor cellular service.
CrowdStrike said it had obtained the information on D-30 howitzer losses from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), but as VOA pointed out, the loss estimates actually come from a pro-Russia website that published its own interpretation of some IISS reports.
Pavlo Narozhnyy, a technical adviser to Ukraine’s military, told VOA that he doubts the D-30 app can be hacked, and he claimed that none of the app’s users reported any D-30 howitzer losses.
Carr also highlighted that the malware-infected app may have not actually made it onto a single Ukrainian soldier’s Android device, considering that each user needed to contact Sherstuk personally to obtain an activation code.
“Crowdstrike never contacted the app’s developer to inform him about their findings. Had they performed that simple courtesy, they might have learned from Jaroslav Sherstuk how improbable, if not impossible, their theory was,” Carr said. “Instead, they worked inside of their own research bubble, performed no verification of infected applications or tablets used by Ukraine’s artillery corps, and extrapolated an effect of 80% losses based upon a self-proclaimed, pro-Russian propagandist and an imaginary number of infected applications.”
CrowdStrike stands by its findings and is confident that the military app has been hacked by the Fancy Bear group.",https://www.securityweek.com/experts-doubt-russia-used-malware-track-ukrainian-troops
48,APT28,"Microsoft Patches Windows Zero-Day Exploited by Russian Hackers

The 14 security bulletins released on Tuesday by Microsoft address many serious issues, including a couple of Windows vulnerabilities actively exploited by malicious actors and bugs for which exploits are already publicly available.
One of the zero-days has been patched with MS16-135, a bulletin rated important. MS16-135 fixes two information disclosure and three privilege escalation flaws, one of which is a Windows kernel bug exploited in attacks by a Russia-linked cyber espionage group to elevate privileges and escape the browser sandbox.
The zero-day, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was reported to Microsoft by Google researchers on October 21 and it was disclosed by the search giant ten days later. Google typically gives vendors a few months to patch vulnerabilities, but the deadline is only 7 days for flaws exploited in the wild.
While Google decided that it would be in the best interest of users to disclose the vulnerability, Microsoft disagreed and criticized the company for putting its customers at risk. Microsoft said the vulnerability had been exploited in a low-volume spear-phishing campaign by the threat group known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team.
The vulnerability affects Windows Vista through Windows 10 Anniversary Update, but new mitigations prevent exploitation against the latter. The same attacks also leverage a Flash Player vulnerability that Adobe patched on October 26.
This is not the only zero-day vulnerability patched by Microsoft on Tuesday. The critical security bulletin MS16-132 addresses several issues related to the Windows Media Foundation, the Windows Animation Manager and OpenType fonts, including a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7256) caused due to the way the Windows font library handles specially crafted embedded fonts.
The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, but Microsoft has not shared any details on these attacks. The company said the flaw can be exploited via specially crafted websites or documents that victims must open in order to trigger the exploit.
Microsoft also patched a couple of vulnerabilities that have not been exploited in the wild, but for which exploits are publicly available. This includes a browser information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2016-7199) and an Edge spoofing flaw (CVE-2016-7209) – both fixed with MS16-129.
Other critical security bulletins resolve various Windows vulnerabilities, including issues affecting Video Control, the Input Method Editor (IME) and the Task Scheduler. Important bulletins fix security holes in the Windows Virtual Hard Disk Driver, SQL Server, Windows authentication methods, the Windows kernel, Secure Boot, the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver, and Office.
Adobe also released security updates this Patch Tuesday. The company addressed one vulnerability in Connect for Windows and nine arbitrary code execution flaws in Flash Player. The Flash Player issues have also been patched in Internet Explorer and Edge with the MS16-141 critical bulletin.

49,APT28,"Pawn Storm Group Targets Turkey

Pawn Storm, the cyber espionage group linked by some researchers to Russia, has recently started targeting government and news organizations in Turkey, Trend Micro reported on Monday.
The economic and politically-motivated threat actor, which has been active for the past decade, is also known as APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, Fancy Bear and Tsar Team. The group has focused its activities on individuals and military, government, media and defense organizations from across the world, including Ukraine, Poland, Russia, the United States, and various NATO member countries. The list of known targets also includes governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Trend Micro recently discovered that Turkey has also been added to Pawn Storm’s list of targets. More precisely, starting with mid-January and until late February, the group was spotted attacking the Turkish government’s Directorate General of Press and Information, the country’s Grand National Assembly, the newspaper Hürriyet, and the Prime Minister’s Office (Başbakanlık).
Experts noted that if Pawn Storm is really a Russian group, it would make sense for it to target Turkey. Russia could have an interest in Turkey for several reasons, including the incident in which Turkey shot down a Russian warplane in the Turkey-Syria border area, disputes related to Kurdish groups, and refugees entering Europe via Turkey.
In one attack against Turkey, Pawn Storm set up fake Outlook Web Access (OWA) servers in order to gain access to sensitive information. The cyber-espionage actor is known for using this technique, including in attacks aimed at defense companies in the U.S. and organizations tasked with investigating the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.
“Phishing attacks against OWA users are relatively inexpensive for the attackers, but can be highly effective to steal sensitive information,” Trend Micro senior threat researcher Feike Hacquebord explained in a blog post.
Similar to other Pawn Storm targets, Turkey could also be perceived as a threat to Russia. Experts believe the latest attacks are related to previous operations targeting the Syrian opposition and Arab countries that criticized Russia’s intervention in Syria.
“The target list above shows that Pawn Storm may be after political information from Turkey: even the Turkish parliament got attacked. The fact they have set up at least two fake OWA servers for one of the largest Turkish newspapers may also be considered as further proof that they are also after information on what is going on in major media outlets in that country,” Hacquebord noted.
Trend Micro said it managed to warn Turkish authorities about the attacks, allowing them to take action before too much damage was caused.
In the operation aimed at Turkey, the cyber espionage group leveraged infrastructure provided by a company in the Netherlands, whose services had been previously used by several other threat actors, including Carbanak cybercriminals and the Gaza cybergang.

50,APT28,"'Macronleaks': Hackers Find Flaw in French Cyber-Fortress

They knew months ago that top-of-the-range hackers had been targeting them. They believe their security measures, too, had been nothing short of top-rate. But, in the end, French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's team got hacked.
And on Friday night, just an hour before the end of official campaigning, thousands of documents including emails and accounts belonging to his En Marche! (On the Move!) movement were dumped online.
""It's just incredible what's happening,"" said Belgian researcher Nicolas Vanderbiest, a specialist on online rumours, whose map showing how the ""Macron Leak"" propagated on Twitter has Wikileaks at the centre.
Macron's campaign team says it put in place servers protected by sophisticated software filters, recommended the use of several encrypted messaging and cellphone networks, and required double and triple authentication to access emails.
It says it stored its information in multiple-partitioned cells, with databases separated like fortresses, accessible by passwords that were complex and regularly changed.
But a squad of shadowy hackers seem to have found the back door.
""In this kind of organisation the real potential faultline is the human element,"" the head of computer services for En Marche! recently told AFP, requesting anonymity.
Because security procedures can become long and cumbersome, some people can be tempted to get around them by using personal email services which are little or badly protected.
- 'en-nnarche.com' -
On April 25, a report by Japanese cyber-security company Trend Micro, blamed a so-called ""phishing"" attack targetting the Macron campaign on Russian hacking group Pawn Storm, also known as Fancy Bears, Tsar Team and APT28.
The group, suspected of close links to the Russian security services, is also accused of having targetted the Democratic Party during last year's US presidential election, in which Republican-backed Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.
In this kind of attack, which does not require sophisticated resources, hackers can open up security gaps in software, for example during an update or through a so-called mirror site.
This would be something like ""en-nnarche.com"", hoping that a user when reading quickly would mistake the ""nn"" for an ""m"" and fall into the trap, revealing access codes.
The principle of phishing, a classic arm in the hackers' arsenal, is to send a large number of fake emails often containing infected attachments, hoping that a distracted recipient will click on one, creating a breach in the targetted system.
The gap is unlikely to show up immediately, and the loophole it generates may be exploited weeks or months later.
The Macron campaign reacted swiftly to Friday night's data dump, saying it would take all measures necessary to shed light on the ""unprecedented"" incident.
But it did not seem overly worried by the substance of what had been leaked.
""Throughout the campaign, En Marche! has constantly been the party the most targeted by such attempts, in an intense and repeated fashion,"" it said in a lengthy statement.
""The aim of those behind this leak is, all evidence suggests, to hurt the En Marche! party. Clearly, the documents arising from the hacking are all lawful and show the normal functioning of a presidential campaign.""
Senator Bazira Khiari, a national delegate for En Marche!, told AFP Saturday morning: ""We were informed last night...  We were just told to change our passwords"".",https://www.securityweek.com/macronleaks-hackers-find-flaw-french-cyber-fortress
51,APT28,"German Spy Service Says Russia Behind Major Cyber Attacks

'Evidence' Russia Behind Cyber Attacks in Germany: Secret Service
Germany's domestic secret service said Friday it had evidence that Russia was behind a series of cyber attacks, including one that targeted the German parliament last year.
The operations cited by the BfV intelligence agency ranged from an aggressive attack called Sofacy or APT 28 that hit NATO members and knocked French TV station TV5Monde off air, to a hacking campaign called Sandstorm that brought down part of Ukraine's power grid last year.
""Cyberspace is a place for hybrid warfare. It opens a new space of operations for espionage and sabotage,"" said Hans-Georg Maassen, who heads the BfV agency.
""The campaigns being monitored by the BfV are generally about obtaining information, that is spying,"" he said. ""However, Russian secret services have also shown a readiness to carry out sabotage.""
Germany itself fell victim to one of these rogue operations, with the Sofacy attack last year hitting the German lower house of parliament.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party confirmed it had been targeted in April, adding that ""we have adapted our IT infrastructure as a result"".

Government, military, media
IT experts believe that Sofacy or APT 28 is a so-called phishing tool of the broader Operation Pawn Storm, that has been blamed for targeting NATO and the US government and military as well as Ukrainian activists and Russian dissidents.
The operation included the attempted hacking of the Dutch Safety Board's computer systems by Russian spies seeking to access a sensitive final report into the July 2014 shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine, according to security experts Trend Micro.
It also hit France's TV5Monde television channel last April, shutting down transmissions and placing jihadist propaganda messages on the station's website, Facebook and Twitter accounts.
The station had initially focused investigations on the IS group, after the perpetrators claimed to be members of the jihadist organisation.
But in June, a French judicial source put the blame on Russian hackers.
""Sandworm"" meanwhile refers to a group of hackers who deploy the malware known as Black Energy and KillDisk through phishing emails.
BfV said Sandworm targeted not just government posts, but ""was also aimed at telecommunications companies, energy providers as well as higher education facilities"".
The West has been boosting resources and tightening cooperation to fight the mounting threat of international cyber attacks, with cyber defence designated as a core NATO task.

52,APT28,"Sofacy Threat Group Targets US Government

The Sofacy threat group has been spotted sending a spear phishing email to a United States government agency from an apparently compromised email account belonging to a government organization in a different country.
Sofacy is a Russia-linked cyber espionage group that is also known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear and Tsar Team. According to Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 research team, the threat actor recently attempted to deliver a piece of malware to an unnamed U.S. government organization.
The email carrying the malware came from an email address belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a different country. Since the email address did not appear to be spoofed, experts believe the attackers likely compromised the email account or a host within the government organization.
The email, titled “FW: Exercise Noble Partner 2016,” carried an RTF file designed to exploit an Office vulnerability patched by Microsoft in April 2015 (CVE-2015-1641) to deliver what researchers call a Carberp-based variant of the Sofacy Trojan. Sofacy has been known to use leaked Carberp source code in the development of its malware.
When the RTF file is opened, CVE-2015-1641 is exploited and two files are dropped – btecache.dll and svchost.dll. The first file, the loader, is designed to execute the second file, which is the actual Trojan. Researchers pointed out that unlike in other attacks, in this case, no decoy documents are dropped or displayed.
Palo Alto Networks noticed that a new persistence tactic was used in this attack. The registry key that is created for persistence is set up to run the malware only when the victim opens a Microsoft Office application, instead of launching it directly at system startup.
“This is the first time Unit 42 has seen the Sofacy group, or any other threat group for that matter, use this tactic for persistence purposes,” researchers noted in a blog post. “An added benefit for the threat actor to using this specific tactic for persistence is that it requires user interaction to load and execute the malicious payload, which can cause challenges for detection in automated sandboxes.”
The document attached to the spear phishing email targeting the U.S. government entity referenced a joint military training exercise that took place in May between Georgia and the United States. Researchers also reported seeing documents referencing the Russian military – these had been used in attacks against Poland.
Sofacy has been known to target organizations from all around the world. The threat group was recently observed attacking the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the political party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, and various media and government organizations in Turkey.

53,APT28,"Russia-Linked Cyberspies Target Google Accounts

The notorious cyberespionage group Pawn Storm has targeted a significant number of Google accounts belonging to individuals in Russia, the United States, Europe and former Soviet Union countries.
The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, TG-4127, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team. It is one of the two supposedly Russian threat groups believed to have breached the systems of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC).
Shortly after news broke that Russian hackers had targeted DNC systems, researchers at SecureWorks reported that Pawn Storm had attempted to steal credentials associated with nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. The list of targets included people working for or associated with the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
A new report published this week by SecureWorks details an earlier spear phishing campaign that targeted over 1,800 Google accounts. While many of them belonged to people in Russia and former Soviet Union states, some of the targets were current and former government and military personnel in the United States and Europe, and foreign authors and journalists interested in Russia.
“The range of targets demonstrates that the threat group poses a broad threat to individuals and groups associated with U.S. politics, to organizations and individuals in the government and defense verticals, and to those whose business involves commenting on Russia,” SecureWorks researchers noted.
In this campaign, attackers used a domain named “accoounts-google.com” to trick users into handing over their Google credentials. A link to this phishing website was disguised using the Bit.ly URL shortening service and sent via email to targeted individuals.
An analysis of the targeted accounts revealed that Pawn Storm was mostly after information on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine. Attackers also attempted to hack into the accounts of journalists, advocacy groups and human rights organizations in Russia, and political, military and diplomatic targets in former Soviet countries.
Outside Russia and the former Soviet Union, attackers targeted military personnel, authors and journalists, NGOs, people involved in government and defense supply chains, government personnel, aerospace researchers, aviation professionals and political activists. A majority of the government and military targets were from the United States and NATO member countries.
Researchers discovered nearly 4,400 phishing URLs sent to the owners of more than 1,800 Google accounts between March and September 2015. An analysis of the URLs showed that 59 percent of them were clicked, but it’s unclear how many users actually took the bait.
While many of the accounts received multiple phishing URLs, roughly one-third of them were only targeted once and 60 percent of these recipients clicked the malicious link, which could indicate that they were successfully compromised.

54,APT28,"Adobe Patches 9 Flash Player Flaws Reported via ZDI

Security updates released by Adobe on this Patch Tuesday address one vulnerability in Connect for Windows and nine arbitrary code execution flaws in Flash Player.
Flash Player 23.0.0.207 for Windows, Mac and web browsers, and Flash Player 11.2.202.644 for Linux patch type confusion and use-after-free vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2016-7857, CVE-2016-7858, CVE-2016-7859, CVE-2016-7860, CVE-2016-7861, CVE-2016-7862, CVE-2016-7863, CVE-2016-7864 and CVE-2016-7865.
All of the issues addressed on this occasion have been reported to Adobe through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) by various researchers, including bo13oy of CloverSec Labs, Archer, Kiritou Kureha, Erisaka Mafuyu, Onoe Serika, Kuchiki Toko and Takanashi Rikka.
Adobe has also informed customers of a Connect update that resolves an input validation vulnerability in the events registration module. The flaw, reported by Vulnerability Lab, can be exploited for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
The issue affects versions 9.5.6 and earlier for Windows, and it was fixed with the release of Connect 9.5.7. Adobe said there was no evidence that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited in the wild.
A Flash Player vulnerability exploited in targeted attacks was addressed by Adobe on October 26. The flaw (CVE-2016-7855) has been used by the Russia-linked threat actor known as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear.
Attackers leveraged the security hole in combination with a Windows kernel weakness – the Flash Player bug was used to gain control of the victim’s browser process and the Windows bug was exploited to elevate privileges and escape the browser sandbox.
Both Adobe and Microsoft were informed about the vulnerabilities by Google on October 21, but Microsoft only managed to patch the Windows flaw on Tuesday with its monthly security updates.",https://www.securityweek.com/adobe-patches-9-flash-player-flaws-reported-zdi
55,APT28,"Malicious PDF Leads to Discovery of Adobe Reader, Windows Zero-Days

Researchers at ESET recently came across a malicious PDF file set up to exploit two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Microsoft Windows.
The malicious document leverages a privilege escalation flaw in Windows (CVE-2018-8120) and a remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Reader (CVE-2018-4990). CVE-2018-8120 is one of the two zero-day vulnerabilities fixed by Microsoft with its May 2018 Patch Tuesday updates, while CVE-2018-4990 was addressed by Adobe on May 14 with the release of updates that fix nearly 50 other issues.
By combining the two flaws, attackers can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges with minimal user interaction – specifically, opening the malicious PDF.
In order to make it more difficult for attackers to execute arbitrary code on a system running its Reader software, Adobe has implemented a sandbox. Exploiting only CVE-2018-4990 allows code execution within the sandbox, but combining it with the Windows privilege escalation flaw makes it possible to escape the sandbox and execute the code in kernel mode.
It’s worth noting that CVE-2018-8120 only affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 – newer versions of the operating system include security features that prevent attacks.
ESET discovered the malicious PDF in a public malware repository (likely VirusTotal). However, the company has not shared any information on who may have found the flaws and who the attackers may have planned on targeting.
“Even though the sample does not contain a real malicious final payload, which may suggest that it was caught during its early development stages, the author(s) demonstrated a high level of skills in vulnerability discovery and exploit writing,” explained Anton Cherepanov, the ESET researcher credited by Microsoft and Adobe for reporting the flaws.
ESET has published a blog post containing technical information on both vulnerabilities.
At the time of writing, 18 of the 59 antivirus engines on VirusTotal detect the files discovered by ESET as a generic Trojan or exploit.
Using two zero-day exploits in a single file is not unheard of. Last year, the Russia-linked threat actor known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium leveraged an Office RCE flaw (CVE-2017-0262) and a Windows privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0263) to deliver malware.

56,APT28,"U.S. Gov's ""GRIZZLY STEPPE"" Report Fails to Achieve Purpose: Experts

The recently released Joint Analysis Report (JAR) published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to detail tools used by Russian hackers in cyber attacks against the United States election didn’t deliver on its promise, security experts argue.
The United States government said from the start that the JAR was meant to offer declassified technical information on the malicious cyber activity carried out by Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) referred to as GRIZZLY STEPPE. The information was also meant for network defenders in the United States and abroad to use to better “identify, detect, and disrupt Russia’s global campaign of malicious cyber activities.”
But the information included in the JAR isn’t enough to help improve defenses, some experts argue. What’s more, some suggest that ""evidence"" provided in the report that Cozy Bear (APT29) and Fancy Bear (APT28) were behind the election-focused attacks doesn’t actually prove that Russia was behind the attacks.
The report included a series of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), but security exert Robert Graham explains that they are of low quality, have limited utility to defenders, and “are published as a political tool, to prove they have evidence pointing to Russia.”
One of these is the YARA rule included in the report, which is a tool security researchers use to classify files and to analyze infected systems for attribution purposes. The YARA rule in US-CERT's GRIZZLY STEPPE report detects a web shell tool popular among Russia/Ukraine hackers, namely the “PAS TOOL WEB KIT.”
Graham argues that, because it can find the same web shell on all the victims, the YARA rule is useful at tracking the activity of hackers because they tend to continue using tools they are accustomed with. The issue with the JAR, however, is that the YARA it mentions is used to track a P.A.S. web shell used by “hundreds if not thousands of hackers,” which makes attribution problematic. Unless, Graham says, the report withholds some of the information used for attribution.
“We have little visibility into how the government used these IoCs. IP addresses and YARA rules like this are weak, insufficient for attribution by themselves. On the other hand, if they've got web server logs from multiple victims where commands from those IP addresses went to this specific web shell, then the attribution would be strong that all these attacks are by the same actor,” Graham says.
Robert M. Lee, CEO and Founder of security company Dragos, also believes that the report provides weak evidence for attribution and that the technical details included in it fail to achieve the intended purpose: it doesn’t help network defenders and doesn’t reveal new information on the two APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) either, although it attributes the attacks to them (yet without offering the evidence everyone was expecting).
As Lee points out, a Fact Sheet published by the White House to accompany the announcement of various sanctions against Russia (intended as retaliation for RIS’ malicious cyber-activity), suggested that the JAR would contain declassified information on Russian malware, provide details on new tactics and techniques used by Russia, and also validate previously published private sector data. But it does none of those.
“Unfortunately, while the intent was laid out clearly by the White House that intent was not captured in the DHS/FBI report,” Lee notes. In fact, he suggests that the report creates confusion by interweaving unrelated data; that it fails to provide a source for the presented data (which makes the information useless); and that some of the provided indicators of compromise, such as the IP addresses, are nearly useless (they are VPS, TOR exit nodes, proxies, and other non-descriptive internet traffic sites).
According to Lee, however, this didn’t happen because the government operators who compiled the report didn’t do their job properly, but because the report then went through a series of reviews and sanitation operations that stripped out the best information. According to Lee, this is something that usually happens when the U.S. Intelligence Community releases any kind of information to the public.
Lee also says that the technical data and attribution are likely being included in a report prepared for Congress and which could be later declassified. “Yet, the GRIZZLY STEPPE report reads like a poorly done vendor intelligence report stringing together various aspects of attribution without evidence,” Lee says.
“The DHS/FBI GRIZZLY STEPPE report does not meet its stated intent of helping network defenders and instead choose to focus on a confusing assortment of attribution, non-descriptive indicators, and re-hashed tradecraft. Additionally, the bulk of the report (8 of the 13 pages) is general high level recommendations not descriptive of the RIS threats mentioned and with no linking to what activity would help with what aspect of the technical data covered. It simply serves as an advertisement of documents and programs the DHS is trying to support,” Lee also says.
Mark Maunder, Wordfence Founder and CEO, explains that an analysis of the PHP malware samples included in the JAR revealed that it was an older variant of P.A.S., namely version 3.1.0, which is “commonly available”. The malware’s site, he also reveals, points at newer versions of the malware, namely 3.1.7 and 4.1.1b and claims that Ukrainians developed it.
“One might reasonably expect Russian intelligence operatives to develop their own tools or at least use current malicious tools from outside sources,” Maunder says.
He also explains that 134 or about 15% of the 876 IP addresses listed in the report are Tor exit nodes, which are “are anonymous gateways that are used by anyone using the Tor anonymous browsing service.” What’s more, most of the top 50 most active IP addresses by number of complex attacks they were used in during the past 60 days, are Tor exit nodes, meaning they can’t be used for attribution.
“The IP addresses that DHS provided may have been used for an attack by a state actor like Russia. But they don’t appear to provide any association with Russia. They are probably used by a wide range of other malicious actors, especially the 15% of IP addresses that are Tor exit nodes. The malware sample is old, widely used and appears to be Ukrainian. It has no apparent relationship with Russian intelligence and it would be an indicator of compromise for any website,” Maunder concludes.
Responding to an email inquiry, Chris Roberts, chief security architect at Acalvio, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based threat detection firm, told SecurityWeek that the report is fuzzy and non-committal, and that this is its main issue.
“It doesn't come out and say ""Hey the FSB and GRU hacked us"" and has done so for the last 10-20 years. It simply refers to APT (actors) and insinuates that they are part of the establishment as opposed to providing actual details,” he said.
Paul Calatayud, CTO at FireMon, also told SecurityWeek that the report doesn’t offer new information regarding the activities of these threat groups: “Upon review, there is nothing new in regards to these actors and the techniques they are using. The newsworthy elements here are the source of the actors and their motivations in hitting political systems and implications of what it means in regards to national security.”

57,APT28,"Windows Zero-Day Exploited by Russia-Linked Cyberspies

The Windows zero-day vulnerability disclosed this week by Google has been exploited by the Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Strontium. Microsoft has been working on a patch and expects to release it on November 8.
Google informed Adobe and Microsoft on October 21 that malicious actors had been actively exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in Flash Player (CVE-2016-7855) and the Windows kernel. The companies were given 7 days to patch the flaws or publish workarounds that would help users protect themselves against attacks.
Adobe released a patch for Flash Player on October 26, but since Microsoft had not come up with a fix or a workaround, Google decided that it would be in the best interest of users to disclose the Windows flaw. Microsoft does not agree and accused Google of putting its customers at risk.
In a blog post published on Tuesday, Microsoft revealed that the Windows vulnerability has been exploited by the group tracked by the company as Strontium. The threat actor is also known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team.
The group, which many believe is sponsored by the Russian government, has been linked to numerous high-profile attacks, including ones aimed at the U.S. Democratic Party, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), investigators of the flight MH17 crash, and government organizations in Germany and Turkey.
According to Microsoft, the Windows flaw exploited by the group in a low-volume spear-phishing campaign affects Windows Vista through Windows 10 Anniversary Update, but the exploit does not work against the latter due to new mitigations implemented recently by Microsoft.
The attackers have been leveraging the Flash Player vulnerability to gain control of the victim’s browser process, after which they use the Windows kernel flaw to elevate their privileges and escape the browser sandbox. In the last phase of the attack, a backdoor that gives attackers access to the victim’s device is downloaded and executed.
While Microsoft will only release a patch next Tuesday, the company pointed out that security features in Edge, and Device Guard for Internet Explorer and other browsers, should block the final stages of the attack. Furthermore, the company says its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) system also detects and blocks these attacks.

58,APT28,"Adobe Patches Flash Zero-Day Exploited in Targeted Attacks

Adobe has patched vulnerabilities in nine of its products, including Flash Player, which is affected by a zero-day flaw that has been exploited in targeted attacks.
Flash Player 24.0.0.186 resolves a total of 17 vulnerabilities, a majority of which can be exploited for arbitrary code execution. The most interesting of the security holes is CVE-2016-7892, a use-after-free reported to Adobe by an individual who wanted to remain anonymous.
According to Adobe, an exploit for CVE-2016-7892 exists in the wild and the vulnerability has been leveraged in limited, targeted attacks aimed at Windows users running a 32-bit version of Internet Explorer.
The other Flash Player vulnerabilities were reported to Adobe by independent researchers and experts from Microsoft, Pangu LAB, Tencent, CloverSec Labs, Qihoo 360, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and Palo Alto Networks.
The Flash Player patches have also been included in one of the security bulletins released by Microsoft on Tuesday.
Adobe also announced the availability of security updates that patch a memory corruption flaw in Animate, two cross-site scripting (XSS) issues in Experience Manager Forms, and a critical memory corruption in DNG Converter.
Three XSS and one cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaws in Experience Manager, a memory corruption in InDesign, information disclosure bugs in ColdFusion Builder and Digital Editions, and an XSS flaw in RoboHelp have also been patched.
The software giant said there was no evidence that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited in the wild.
While the Patch Tuesday updates released by Adobe in the past three months did not address any zero-days, Adobe did release an out-of-band patch for Flash Player in late October to fix a use-after-free exploited in a low-volume spear phishing campaign by the Russia-linked threat actor known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team.

59,APT28,"Russia Used Android Malware to Track Ukrainian Troops: Report

The Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear has tracked Ukrainian artillery forces by planting a piece of Android malware in a legitimate military application, threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike reported on Thursday.
Fancy Bear is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit. The group is believed to be responsible for many high-profile attacks, including recent operations aimed at the U.S. Democratic Party, government organizations in Turkey and Germany, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
CrowdStrike believes Fancy Bear is likely tied to GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia’s Armed Forces, and the company’s recent findings reinforce this theory.
This summer, the company’s analysts came across an Android application package (APK) file named “Попр-Д30.apk.” The file contained Russian-language artifacts and its name referenced the D-30, a Russian-made 122 mm towed howitzer that first entered service in the 1960s.
The D-30 is still used by the Ukrainian military and, in 2013, artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk created an Android app designed to help personnel reduce the time to fire the gun from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to its developer, the application has roughly 9,000 users.
According to CrowdStrike, Fancy Bear took the legitimate Android app and bundled it with an Android variant of X-Agent, a piece of malware that has been used by the threat actor in attacks aimed at high-value targets, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
The malicious version of the app was distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016. Experts believe the legitimate program had been mainly distributed through social media, not via the Google Play store.
The Android variant of the X-Agent malware appears to be designed for strategic purposes as it does not cause any damage to the infected device and it does not interfere with the operation of the original app. X-Agent is capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data.
“CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit’s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, and even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting,” CrowdStrike wrote in its report.
“Additionally, a study provided by the International Institute of Strategic Studies determined that the weapons platform bearing the highest losses between 2013 and 2016 was the D-30 towed howitzer. It is possible that the deployment of this malware infected application may have contributed to the high-loss nature of this platform,” the report adds.
The threat intelligence firm pointed out that the purpose of the malicious D-30 app further strengthens its belief that Fancy Bear is likely affiliated with Russia’s GRU agency.

60,APT28,"Windows 10 Blocks Zero-Days Before Patches Arrive: Microsoft

Unknown to vendors but exploited by cybercriminals, zero-day vulnerabilities are the most threatening security issues, but Microsoft's Windows 10 can block exploitation of these vulnerabilities before they are even patched, Microsoft says.
The mitigation techniques that arrived in August 2016 as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update make all this possible. The update was meant to harden the platform to ensure it can stop exploits of newly discovered and even undisclosed vulnerabilities before a patch is released, and Microsoft claims that it already proved to be effective against two exploits associated with well-known threat groups.
More precisely, the deployed mitigation techniques did their job and successfully blocked kernel-level exploits for the CVE-2016-7255 and CVE-2016-7256 vulnerabilities before they were patched in November 2016, the tech behemoth explains. The former is a Win32k Elevation of Privilege Exploit, while the latter is an Open Type Font Exploit.
CVE-2016-7255, a type-confusion vulnerability in win32k.sys, was exploited by the STRONTIUM attack group to gain elevated privileges on compromised systems. To get access to the targeted computers, the group used an Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2016-7855). The two exploits were used in a small spear-phishing campaign targeting think tanks and nongovernmental organizations in the United States.
Also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, APT28, Sednit, and Sofacy, this threat group was recently officially blamed for last year’s cyber-attacks on U.S. elections, albeit the U.S. government failed to provide proper evidence on attribution.
The STRONTIUM group, Microsoft says, leveraged the Win32k exploit in attacks in October 2016, where they attempted to corrupt the tagWND.strName structure and use SetWindowTextW to write arbitrary content anywhere in kernel memory. Abusing the API call to overwrite data of current processes and copy token privileges of the SYSTEM, the exploit allowed attackers to run victim processes with elevated privileges.
The Windows 10 Anniversary Update includes techniques that prevent abusive use of tagWND.strName, thus mitigating the Win32k exploit and similar exploits. According to the software company, tests have proven that exploits abusing this method are ineffective and instead cause exceptions and subsequent blue screen errors.
The CVE-2016-7256 vulnerability in the Windows font library, on the other hand, was being abused to install a backdoor known as Hankray on targeted computers with older versions of Windows. The backdoor had been previously spotted in low-volume attacks primarily focused on targets in South Korea.
“The font samples found on affected computers were specifically manipulated with hardcoded addresses and data to reflect actual kernel memory layouts. This indicates the likelihood that a secondary tool dynamically generated the exploit code at the time of infiltration,” Microsoft says.
Designed to copy the main body of the shellcode to newly allocated memory and run it, the stage 1 shellcode is very small, the tech giant explains. The main shellcode, which runs after the copy instructions, while also small, performs a token-stealing technique, then copies the token pointer from a SYSTEM process to the target process, achieving privilege escalation.
The Windows 10 Anniversary Update can prevent the exploit because font parsing happens completely in AppContainer instead of the kernel. Because it creates an isolated sandbox, AppContainer can prevent font exploits (among other types of exploits) from achieving privilege escalation. Moreover, the platform includes additional validation for font file parsing.
According to Microsoft, the main idea behind the hardening of Windows 10 is to ensure that mitigation techniques in the platform can tackle multiple exploits instead of focusing on neutralizing a specific bug. These mitigation techniques can either break exploit methods or close entire classes of vulnerabilities, and Microsoft plans on taking this prevention to a new level in Windows 10 Creators Update, which will include generic kernel exploit detection Windows Defender ATP, expected to deliver increased visibility into targeted attacks based on zero-day exploits.
“By delivering these mitigation techniques, we are increasing the cost of exploit development, forcing attackers to find ways around new defense layers. Even the simple tactical mitigation against popular RW primitives forces the exploit authors to spend more time and resources in finding new attack routes. By moving font parsing code to an isolated container, we significantly reduce the likelihood that font bugs are used as vectors for privilege escalation,” Microsoft also says.

61,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Use ""Komplex"" Trojan to Target OS X Systems

Researchers at Palo Alto Networks have come across an OS X Trojan they believe has been used by a notorious Russia-linked cyber espionage group in attacks aimed at the aerospace industry.
The malware, dubbed “Komplex,” appears to have been developed by the threat actor known as Sofacy, Pawn Storm, APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear and Tsar Team. The gang has been tied to numerous high-profile attacks, including ones aimed at the U.S. government and the country’s political parties, the German parliament, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
According to Palo Alto Networks, Komplex attacks start with a binder component that deploys a decoy document, which is displayed with the Preview application in OS X, and the Trojan’s dropper. The dropper component is designed to drop and execute the main payload and ensure its persistence by configuring the system to launch it when OS X starts.
Once it infects a device, the malware establishes contact with its command and control (C&C) server and collects system information. The Trojan allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands and download additional files to the affected machine.
Palo Alto Networks’ analysis revealed that Komplex is likely the unnamed Mac Trojan described in a June 2015 blog post by BAE Systems. At the time, the malware had been delivered via a vulnerability in the MacKeeper security and optimization software.
Researchers also discovered links between Komplex and the variant of the Carberp malware used by the Sofacy group in attacks targeting the U.S. government. While Carberp is designed to target Windows systems, experts have identified several similarities, including in URL generation logic, file extensions, encryption and decryption methods, command handling, and Internet connectivity checks.
“Based on these observations, we believe that the author of Sofacy’s Carberp variant used the same code, or at least the same design, to create the Komplex Trojan,” Palo Alto Networks explained in a blog post. “A benefit of retaining many of the same functionalities within the Windows and OS X Trojans is that it would require fewer alterations to the C2 server application to handle cross-platform implants.”
Experts also uncovered C&C infrastructure overlaps as some of the domains used by Komplex are known to be associated with Sofacy activity.
Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, told SecurityWeek that they first detected Komplex at the beginning of August. While there is no indication of significant changes in the malware functionality compared to the variant analyzed by BAE Systems last year, the attackers have apparently switched from exploiting MacKeeper vulnerabilities to using decoy documents.
While experts have not been able to precisely determine which organizations have been targeted with this OS X Trojan, based on decoy documents, they believe one of the targets was likely associated with the aerospace industry.

Russian cyber-espionage group Fancy Bear is the first threat actor to have used a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) rootkit in a malicious campaign, ESET’s security researchers claim.
Several years ago, Italy-based surveillance software maker Hacking Team was said to have used a UEFI rootkit to ensure the persistence of its software on targeted systems, but no UEFI rootkit had “ever been detected in the wild,” the security firm claims.
A recently discovered Fancy Bear campaign, however, changes that: the actor was able to successfully deploy a malicious UEFI module on a victim’s system. Not only does this prove that UEFI rootkits are a real threat, but also shows that Fancy Bear may be even more dangerous than thought, ESET says.
Active for the past decade and a half, the actor, which is also referred to as APT28, Strontium, Sofacy and Sednit, is believed to have orchestrated a variety of high profile attacks, such as the DNC hack before the US 2016 elections.
Earlier this year, after the group’s Zerbrocy malware was found on systems infected with Turla’s Mosquito backdoor, security researchers concluded that the threat actor’s activities overlap with other state-sponsored operations.
“Our investigation has determined that this malicious actor was successful at least once in writing a malicious UEFI module into a system’s SPI flash memory. This module is able to drop and execute malware on disk during the boot process. This persistence method is particularly invasive as it will not only survive an OS reinstall, but also a hard disk replacement,” ESET reveals in a report published today.
In May, Fancy Bear was revealed to have abused LoJack (a Trojanized version of the tool, which ESET calls LoJax) in their attacks. Deeper analysis of the campaign revealed not only that the actor attempted to mimic the tool’s persistence method, but also that additional tools were used for accessing and modifying UEFI/BIOS settings.
These include a kernel driver and three tools to (1) dump information about low level system settings, (2) save an image of the system firmware, and (3) add a malicious UEFI module to the image. The third tool would then write the modified firmware image back to the SPI flash memory, thus effectively installing the UEFI rootkit on the system.
“If the platform allows write operations to the SPI flash memory, it will just go ahead and write to it. If not, it actually implements an exploit against a known vulnerability,” ESET reveals.
The UEFI rootkit was designed to drop malware onto the Windows operating system partition and make sure that it is executed at startup.
The observed LoJax samples used command and control (C&C) servers previously associated with Fancy Bear’s SedUploader first-stage backdoor, which, combined with the presence of other Sednit tools on LoJax-infected machines (SedUploader, XAgent backdoor, and Xtunnel network proxy tool), suggested that this threat actor was behind the attacks.
Sednit’s UEFI rootkit, ESET discovered, is not properly signed, meaning that Secure Boot would be able to block it. The security researchers also note that the attack can write the modified firmware image only if SPI flash memory protections are vulnerable or misconfigured.
“The LoJax campaign shows that high-value targets are prime candidates for the deployment of rare, even unique threats and such targets should always be on the lookout for signs of compromise. Also, one thing that this research taught us is that it is always important to dig as deep as you can go!” ESET concludes.

63,APT28,"Oracle Patches Java Zero-Day, 192 Other Security Bugs

Oracle on Tuesday released its July 2015 Critical Patch Update (CPU). The updates address a whopping 193 security issues across multiple product families, including a Java zero-day bug exploited in the wild by a sophisticated threat group.
Trend Micro revealed earlier this week that an unpatched Java vulnerability had been exploited by the advanced persistent threat (APT) group Pawn Storm (also known as APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, and Sednit) in attacks against the armed forces of a NATO member country, and major defense contractors in the United States and Canada. Researchers noted that this was the first Java zero-day attack reported in almost two years.
After Oracle announced the availability of a patch for the remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2015-2590), Trend Micro published a blog post with additional technical details on the attack.
The security holes addressed by Oracle with the July 2015 CPU affect a wide range of products, including Oracle Database, Fusion Middleware, Hyperion, Enterprise Manager, E-Business Suite, Supply Chain Suite, PeopleSoft Enterprise, Siebel CRM, Communications Applications, Java SE, Sun Systems Products Suite, Linux and Virtualization, and MySQL.
Forty-four of the patched flaws plague third-party components included in Oracle’s product distributions, such as Qemu and Glibc.
A total of 25 vulnerabilities have been addressed in Java SE and 23 of them can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
“16 of these Java SE fixes are for Java client-only, including one fix for the client installation of Java SE. 5 of the Java fixes are for client and server deployment. One fix is specific to the Mac platform. And 4 fixes are for JSSE client and server deployments,’ Eric Maurice, director of Oracle Software Security Assurance, said in a blog post.
The latest CPU resolves ten vulnerabilities in Oracle Database, 39 in Fusion Middleware, 25 in Berkeley DB, two in Communications Applications, 13 in E-Business Suite, seven in Supply Chain Suite, eight in PeopleSoft Enterprise, five in Siebel, and two in Commerce Platform.
Oracle has pointed out that the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores assigned in the advisory released on Tuesday are based on CVSS v2. However, now that CVSS v3 has been released, Oracle intends to move to the new standard in its future alerts and advisories.
Independent researchers and experts from organizations such as Foreground Security, TELUS Security Labs, Evolution Security, Google, Trend Micro, Trustwave, Rapid7, SEC Consult, Red Hat, Ruhr University Bochum, Microsoft, KPMG, Worldpay, E.ON Business Services, NATO Communications and Information Agency, SecureLayer7, HP's Zero Day Initiative, and Help AG have been credited for reporting the vulnerabilities patched with the July 2015 CPU.",https://www.securityweek.com/oracle-patches-java-zero-day-192-other-security-bugs
64,APT28,"Sophisticated False Flags Planted in Olympic Destroyer Malware


CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - The hackers behind the recent Olympic Destroyer attack planted sophisticated false flags inside their malware in an effort to trick researchers, Kaspersky Lab revealed on Thursday.
The Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was hit by a cyberattack that caused temporary disruption to IT systems, including the official Olympics website, display monitors, and Wi-Fi connections. The attack involved Olympic Destroyer, a piece of malware designed to wipe files and make systems inoperable, and steal passwords from browsers and Windows. Compromised credentials are used to spread to other machines on the network.
Kaspersky has also spotted infections at several ski resorts in South Korea. The malware, which leverages a leaked NSA exploit known as EternalRomance to spread via the SMB protocol, temporarily disrupted ski gates and lifts at the affected resorts.
Several cybersecurity firms launched investigations into the Olympic Destroyer attack shortly after the news broke, and while they mostly agreed on the malware’s functionality, they could not agree on who was behind the operation. Some pointed the finger at North Korea, while others blamed China or Russia, leading some industry professionals to warn against this type of knee-jerk attribution.
Kaspersky researchers also analyzed the Olympic Destroyer worm in an effort to determine who was behind the attack. While they have’t been able to identify the culprit, experts have found some interesting clues.
The security firm has found a unique “fingerprint” associated with the notorious Lazarus Group, which has been linked to North Korea and blamed for high profile attacks such as the one on Sony, the WannaCry campaign, and various operations targeting financial organizations.
This fingerprint was a 100% match to known Lazarus malware components and it did not appear in any other files from Kaspersky’s database. While this piece of evidence and the type of attack suggested that Olympic Destroyer could be the work of North Korea, other data gathered by researchers as a result of an on-site investigation at a South Korean target revealed inconsistencies.
Experts determined that the unique fingerprint was likely a sophisticated false flag planted by the attackers to throw investigators off track.
“To our knowledge, the evidence we were able to find was not previously used for attribution. Yet the attackers decided to use it, predicting that someone would find it. They counted on the fact that forgery of this artifact is very hard to prove,” explained Vitaly Kamluk, head of the APAC research team at Kaspersky. “It’s as if a criminal had stolen someone else’s DNA and left it at a crime scene instead of their own. We discovered and proved that the DNA found on the crime scene was dropped there on purpose. All this demonstrates how much effort attackers are willing to spend in order to stay unidentified for as long as possible. We’ve always said that attribution in cyberspace is very hard as lots of things can be faked, and Olympic Destroyer is a pretty precise illustration of this.”
In addition to this apparent link to North Korea, Kaspersky has found evidence that would suggest the involvement of the notorious group known as Sofacy, Fancy Bear, APT28 and Pawn Storm, which is widely believed to be sponsored by the Russian government.
One possible scenario is that the Russian hackers attempted to frame Lazarus for the attack after the North Korean group tried to pin one of its campaigns on Russian actors. It’s also possible that the false flag used in the Olympics attack is part of the hackers’ efforts to improve their deception techniques.
Links to China have been found by Intezer, which specializes in recognizing code reuse. Its analysis led to the discovery of numerous code fragments uniquely linked to threat groups tracked as APT3, APT10 and APT12.

65,APT28,"U.S. Attributes Election Hacks to Russian Threat Groups

U.S. Government Maps Election Hacks to Russian Threat Groups, But Industry Raises Concern Over Attribution Evidence
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Thursday published a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) to detail the tools and infrastructure that Russian hackers used in attacks against the United States election.
The JAR was meant to offer technical details on the cyber activities of Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS), some of which targeted the US government and political and private entities. This is the first time the malicious cyber activity, which the US calls GRIZZLY STEPPE, has been officially attributed to a specific hacking group.
As expected, U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced several retaliatory actions against Moscow, imposing sanctions on two intelligence agencies, expelling 35 diplomats and denying access to two Russian compounds inside the United States.
In October this year, the US government officially accused Russia of involvement in the cyber-attacks against US political organizations, saying that some states had seen scanning and probing activity originating from servers operated by a Russian company, but no attribution was made at the time. The report (PDF) not only makes an attribution, but also provides recommended mitigations and suggested actions to take in response to indicators provided.
The JAR reveals that two different actors participated in the intrusion into a U.S. political party, one in the summer of 2015, namely Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 29, and the other in spring 2016, namely APT28. The former is also known as Cozy Bear, or CozyDuke, while the latter is referred to as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team.
This falls in line with what intelligence firm CrowdStrike revealed in June, after assisting the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the U.S. Democratic Party, to investigate cyber-attacks against its network. Later during summer, two security firms uncovered evidence that Fancy Bear breached the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as well.
Both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear were previously linked to attacks against US government organizations and other governments worldwide. Their attack methods include spearphishing to deliver malicious droppers to the victims’ computers, or the use of short URLs upon the creation of domains closely resembling those of targeted organizations.
“Once APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this information to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting organizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable information from their targets,” the JAR reads.
Previously, security researchers managed to identify some of the tools that these actors use, such as the XTunnel malware that is believed to have been specifically created for the DNC hack. Other malicious applications include the Fysbis backdoor to target Linux machines, the Komplex Trojan targeting OS X systems, and the Carberp malware to compromise Windows computers.
While many in the cybersecurity understandably question the lack of appropriate details to sufficiently attribute the attacks to Russia, the US government maintains its claim that it has enough evidence to link RIS to the recent attacks. Moreover, it says that these aren’t isolated incidents, but that they are part of ongoing campaigns targeting the nation. The security industry, however, has widely criticized IOC-based attribution as a weak “evidence” to confidently point a finger.
In October, Kaspersky Lab security researchers warned of the deep implications of misattribution, suggesting that attribution is difficult, mainly because of the widespread use of sophisticated deception tactics among hacking groups.
“No one should be making any attribution conclusions purely from the indicators in the USCERT report. It was all a jumbled mess,” tweeted Dmitri Alperovitch, Co-Founder & CTO at CrowdStrike.
For US organizations to better protect themselves against such attacks, the JAR provided a list of alternate names associated with RIS, along with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which can be found in the accompanying CSV and STIX xml files, and recommendations regarding the actions that network administrators should take to detect compromise and secure perimeters.
While some industry experts applauded the GRIZZLY STEPPE indicators provided by the U.S. Government, some experts urged caution for those quickly integrating them into their cyber defense measures.
“Be careful using the DHS/FBI GRIZZLY STEPPE indicators. Many are VPS, TOR relays, proxies, etc. which will generate lots of false positives,” Robert M. Lee, founder and CEO of Dragos Security and a former member of the intelligence community, Tweeted.
Via a series of tweets, FireEye’s Chris Sanders also cautioned those eager to quickly implement the list of IPs into network security defenses. “If you try to make an IDS rule out of all those IP’s you’re gonna generate a TON of alerts and have a bad time,” he tweeted. “Don’t build IDS rules from lists of IPs w/o context. This is # of matches for a group of avg size networks over ~30 days for DHS report IPs. “That said, if you want to practice some hunting, go wild. This is a good opportunity to practice your mass triage/search workflow,” he added in a separate tweet.
US President-elect Donald Trump pledged to meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be “updated on the facts” on election related hacks by Russia.

66,APT28,"Russia-Linked Hackers Leak Football Doping Files

A group of hackers believed to be operating out of Russia has leaked emails and medical records related to football (soccer) players who used illegal substances.
The group calls itself Fancy Bears and claims to be associated with the Anonymous hacktivist movement. They have set up a website, fancybears.net, where they leaked numerous files as part of a campaign dubbed “OpOlympics.”
“Today Fancy Bears’ hack team is publishing the material leaked from various sources related to football,” the hackers said. “Football players and officials unanimously affirm that this kind of sport is free of doping. Our team perceived these numerous claims as a challenge and now we will prove they are lying.”
The leaked files include emails exchanged between the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and representatives of anti-doping agencies discussing the test results of various football players. The files also provide information on the number of players using illegal substances -- without specifically naming any players -- and therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which allow athletes to take prohibited substances for medical reasons.
The files contain information on several important players allowed to use TUEs at the 2010 World Cup, including Mario Gomez, Carlos Tevez, Juan Sebastian Veron, Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Nelsen. However, the emails dumped by the hackers are dated as recent as June 2017.

The hackers said they leaked the files to show that more than 150 players were caught doping in 2015, and the number increased to 200 in 2016.
Both the Football Association and FIFA condemned the leak of confidential medical information.
The same hacker group previously targeted the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The hackers now also described the files as “WADA documents” and some of them appear to originate from the Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS). SecurityWeek has reached out to WADA for comment.
While the Fancy Bears that took credit for these attacks claim to be hacktivists, researchers have linked the previous leaks to Fancy Bear, a notorious cyber espionage group believed to be sponsored by the Russian government. The threat actor is tracked by various security firms as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, Tsar Team and Strontium.
The first Fancy Bear leak came shortly after investigations exposed state-sponsored doping in Russia. The latest release may have been triggered by similar events.
“Previous Fancy Bear dumps were almost always retaliatory and in response to sanctions from various international sports organizations. When the Russian athletic team was banned from participating in World Athletics Championships in London, embarrassing IAAF doping reports about major Western athletes were made public,” explained Recorded Future’s Insikt Group.
“As international pressure on Russia intensifies, with open calls to strip Russia of World Cup in 2018 and recent the FIFA investigation into suspected prohibited substance abuse of the national soccer team, today's release was almost guaranteed to surface,” it added. “The message reads very clear and loud - ‘Dare to touch us, we'll come after you. Don't expect us to remain silent and maintain status quo’.”
UPDATE. WADA told SecurityWeek that the leaked files do not originate from its ADAMS system. The organization has provided the following statement:

67,APT28,"Corporate Users Increasingly Targeted With Exploits: Kaspersky

A report published by Kaspersky Lab on Thursday shows that the number of attacks involving exploits increased significantly in 2016 compared to the previous year, but the number of attacked users actually dropped.
The security firm observed more than 700 million attempts to execute an exploit in 2016, which represents a 25% increase compared to 2015. However, the number of users attacked was only 4.3 million, compared to nearly 5.5 million in the previous year.
This indicates that while fewer users encountered exploits, the likelihood of coming across an exploit increased as the number of websites and spam messages delivering such threats has continued to grow.
Of all the exploit attacks observed by Kaspersky in 2016, more than 15% were aimed at corporate machines. The number of targeted corporate users increased from 538,000 in 2015 to 690,000 in 2016.
While Windows and web browsers were the most targeted applications in both 2015 and 2016, their share decreased significantly last year, making more room for Android and Microsoft Office exploits.
“Exploits for vulnerabilities in Office software became the absolute champions in terms of the number of attacked users. They increased by almost 103% to reach 367,167 attacked users,” Kaspersky said in its report.
The security firm said more than 297,000 users were hit by zero-day or heavily obfuscated known exploits in 2016, and the most common exploit, same as in the previous year, was CVE-2010-2568, a vulnerability leveraged by the notorious Stuxnet malware.
Between 2010 and 2016, malicious actors used more than 80 vulnerabilities in targeted attacks. The Russia-linked threat group known as APT28 and Fancy Bear leveraged 25 flaws, including at least six zero-days, followed by the NSA-linked Equation Group, which used roughly 17 vulnerabilities, including at least eight zero-days.
Groups that launched targeted attacks have mainly relied on Windows flaws, followed by Flash Player, Office, Java and Internet Explorer. The most popular vulnerability is CVE-2012-0158, which is still being used by APT actors.

68,APT28,"Usual Threats, But More Sophisticated and Faster: Report

Almost Every Type of Cyber Attack is Increasing in Both Volume and Sophistication
Eight new malware samples were recorded every second during the final three months of 2017. The use of fileless attacks, primarily via PowerShell, grew; and there was a surge in cryptocurrency hijacking malware.
These were the primary threats outlined in the latest McAfee Lab's Threat Report (PDF) covering Q4 2017.
The growth of cryptomining malware coincided with the surge in Bitcoin value, which peaked at just under $20,000 on Dec. 22. With the cost of dedicated mining hardware at upwards of $5,000 per machine, criminals chose to steal users' CPU time via malware. It demonstrates how criminals always follow the money, and choose the least expensive method of acquiring it with the greatest chance of avoiding detection.
Since December, Bitcoin's value has fallen to $9,000 (at the time of publishing). Criminals' focus on Bitcoin is likewise being modified, with Ethereum and Monero becoming popular. Last week, Microsoft discovered a major campaign focused on stealing Electroneum. ""We currently see discussions in underground forums that suggest moving from Bitcoin to Litecoin because the latter is a safer model with less chance of exposure,"" comments Raj Samani, chief scientist and McAfee fellow with the Advanced Threat Research Team.
The speed with which criminals adapt to their latest market conditions is also seen in the way they maximize their asymmetric advantage. ""Adversaries,"" writes Samani, ""have the luxury of access to research done by the technical community, and can download and use opensource tools to support their campaigns, while the defenders’ level of insight into cybercriminal activities is considerably more limited, and identifying evolving tactics often must take place after malicious campaigns have begun.""
Examples of attackers making use of legitimate research include Fancy Bear (APT28) leveraging a Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange technique in November 2017 that had been made public just a few weeks earlier. The hackers used it in a phishing campaign that cited the New York City terror attacks. A second example comes from the December Gold Dragon attacks on organizations involved with the Winter Olympics. In this case the attackers employed steganography, ""and a new tool released days before the attack.""
The speed of changing tactics and adopting new techniques is in sharp contrast to the delays inherent in defending against new vulnerabilities -- with the two-months plus failure of Equifax to patch all of its systems with the Apache Struts patch being a prime example.
Healthcare organizations remained a significant target throughout 2017, with a 210% increase in publicly disclosed incidents, year on year -- although figures declined 78% in Q4. McAfee's research conclusion is that many of the incidents were caused by failures to comply with security best practices or to address vulnerabilities in medical software.
Botnets are a continuing problem. However, in Q4 2017, just two botnets, Necurs and Gamut, accounted for 97% of all spam botnet traffic. Gamut was responsible for delivering job offer-themed phishing (and possible money mule recruitment), in English, German, and Italian; while Necurs delivered 'lonely girl' spam, pump and dump stock spam, and Locky ransomware downloaders.
New ransomware detections grew consistently throughout 2017, culminating in more than 2,000,000 detections in Q4 (compared to less than 500,000 in Q4, 2016). ""A big contributor to ransomware growth was Ransom:Win32/Genasom (also known as Stampado, with variants such as 'Philadelphia'). This family provides an inexpensive entree for cyber criminals, being offered for sale as low as $39 for a lifetime license. 
Ransomware didn't merely increase in volume (59% year on year, and 35% in Q4 alone), it also diversified beyond just extorting money. ""Actors devised strategies to create 'smoke and mirrors' by distracting defenders from actual attacks,"" writes Samani, ""such as the emergence of pseudoransomware, seen in NotPetya and a Taiwan bank heist.""
The big takeaway from the latest McAfee Lab's Threat Report is that the cybersecurity threat landscape is continuing to worsen. Just about every type of attack is increasing in both volume and sophistication. The increasing use of PowerShell and JavaScript to avoid malicious file detection is just one example. In Q1 2016 there were around 2000 detections. By Q4 2017, this had grown to just under 48,000 -- boosted ""by a rash of downloaders in Q4"".",https://www.securityweek.com/usual-threats-more-sophisticated-and-faster-report
69,APT28,"IAAF Says Russia-Linked Hackers Accessed Medical Records

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) revealed on Monday that athletes' medical records were accessed in an attack the organization believes was carried out by the Russia-linked cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear.
Fancy Bear is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team. The group is said to be responsible for many high-profile attacks, including the recent U.S. election hacks.
The IAAF, which is based in Monaco, said it learned of the breach after it hired incident response firm Context Information Security in January to conduct a technical investigation. Investigators found signs of unauthorized remote access on February 21, when they discovered metadata on athletes' Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) applications stored in a newly created file.
The breach impacts athletes who have applied for TUEs since 2012. Affected individuals have been contacted by the IAAF.
It's unclear if the attackers managed to exfiltrate the information they collected, but IAAF believes this provides a strong indication of what the attackers were after. The IAAF is confident the threat actor no longer has access to its networks following clean-up efforts assisted by Context, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the Agence Monégasque de Sécurité Numérique (Monaco AMSN).
This is not the first time Fancy Bear has been accused of targeting an athletic organization. Last year, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said the hackers had stolen sensitive athlete data, including medical test results and TUEs.
Researchers linked the attack on WADA to the Fancy Bear cyberspies, but a group calling itself “Fancy Bears,” claiming to be affiliated with the Anonymous hacktivist movement, also took responsibility for the breach and leaked some of the stolen files.
In the WADA attack, hackers gained unauthorized access to the Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) after using a fake website to phish credentials. In the case of IAAF, there is no information on how the attackers may have gained access to the organization’s systems.

70,APT28,"France TV Cyberattack Probe Focused on 'Russian Hackers'

The investigation into the cyberattack suffered by France's TV5Monde television channel in April is now focusing on ""a group of Russian hackers"", a judicial source told AFP on Tuesday.
The cyberattack was carried out by unknown persons claiming to represent the Islamic State group, who shut down transmissions and placed jihadist propaganda messages on the station's website, and Facebook and Twitter accounts.
But confirming information first published by L'Express newspaper, the judicial source said ""the investigations are at this stage looking towards a group of Russian hackers designated by the name APT28.""
In a report to be published on Wednesday, L'Express said APT28, also known as ""Pawn Storm"", had previously tried to hack the White House and NATO members, as well as targeting Russian dissidents and Ukrainian activists.
A source involved in the case told AFP the investigators were narrowing the search by probing the IP addresses of computers used in the attack.
The TV5Monde station, which broadcasts worldwide, did not resume full operations for 18 hours after the hack on April 8, which authorities at the time said was likely a ""terrorist act"".
The channel was forced to broadcast pre-recorded programs after what TV5Monde boss Yves Bigot described as a cyber-attack ""unprecedented in the history of television.""
The hackers posted documents on TV5Monde's Facebook page purporting to be the identity cards and CVs of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-IS operations, along with threats against the troops.
""Soldiers of France, stay away from the Islamic State! You have the chance to save your families, take advantage of it,"" read one message on the hacked Facebook page.
""The CyberCaliphate continues its cyberjihad against the enemies of Islamic State,"" the message added.
Just hours before the attack, the Islamic State extremist group had published a video praising their ""knights of the media"" carrying out cyber-attacks and urged them to step up their efforts.

71,APT28,"Microsoft Patches Office Zero-Day Bug Used by APT Group

Microsoft on Tuesday patched several memory corruption vulnerabilities in Office, including one that had been exploited in the wild by a well known advanced persistent threat (APT) actor.
Trend Micro reported earlier this week that the Russian threat group Pawn Storm (also known as APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Tsar Team) had been leveraging an Oracle Java zero-day vulnerability in attacks against the armed forces of a NATO member country, and defense organizations in the United States and Canada.
According to iSIGHT Partners, this isn’t the only zero-day bug used recently by the group. On June 30, the threat intelligence company discovered that Pawn Storm had been exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2424). iSIGHT Partners immediately notified Microsoft and the flaw was patched when the company released its July 2015 security updates.
“When we found the exploit it appeared to be under development and evidence suggests it was deployed in Georgia,” iSIGHT Partners noted in a blog post.
The Microsoft Office zero-day exploited by the threat actor is a heap corruption vulnerability triggered during processing of a malformed Microsoft Forms Image. The flaw affects Office 2013 SP1 and prior, and it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted Office document.
In the Pawn Storm attack spotted by iSIGHT, the attackers used a document named “Iran_nuclear_talks.rtf” to hide the exploit. Brian Bartholomew, senior researcher in the Cyber Espionage Threat Intelligence team at iSIGHT Partners, told SecurityWeek that the content of the lure document was ripped from a June 28 CNN article on nuclear talks with Iran.
When the document was opened, an embedded OLE object triggered the vulnerability and a dropper payload was written and executed on the targeted system. The dropper then dropped a Sofacy malware payload.
“Based on several artifacts in the exploit document and the unreliability of successful exploitation when running the exploit document, iSIGHT Partners believes the exploit document was potentially hastily thrown together, or the exploit is still being developed to be more reliable,” iSIGHT explained.
The threat group, which the security firm calls Tsar Team, has also leveraged at least one of the zero-day exploits leaked after the Hacking Team breach.
Bartholomew told SecurityWeek that iSIGHT has observed Tsar Team using one of the three Adobe Flash Player exploits (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team leak.
“While this is the only one we have observed in use by this team, it is not out of the realm of possibility that they may have repurposed any of the other five released zero-days from Hacking Team,” said Bartholomew. “5119 was re-written and in use by Tsar Team within 24 hours of the exploit being released on the Internet.
In April, FireEye reported that the threat group had used Flash Player and Windows zero-days in a highly targeted attack aimed at an international government entity.
iSIGHT Partners has been monitoring the APT actor’s activities and the company believes that the group is actually behind the hacktivist group known as Cyber Caliphate, which attacked several companies apparently in support of ISIS.",https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-patches-office-zero-day-bug-used-apt-group
72,APT28,"Russia's Hackers Long Tied to Military, Secret Services

During the Soviet era, the country's top computer scientists and programmers largely worked for the secret services.
That practice appears to have resumed under President Vladimir Putin, as Russia faces accusations of waging a global campaign of cyber attacks.
Dutch officials on Thursday accused four Russians from the GRU military intelligence agency of attempting to hack into the global chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague.
The agency has investigated both the fatal poisoning of Russian former double-agent Sergei Skripal; and an alleged chemical attack by Moscow-allied Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The Baltic states were the first to accuse Moscow of mounting attacks to knock out their sites back in 2007.
Estonia said one such attack had put the country's main emergency service phone number out of action for over an hour.
Since then, accusations of cyber attacks have continued against Moscow.
The Russian hacker group variously known as Fancy Bear, APT 28 and Sofacy has been linked to GRU and accused of attacks on the US Democrats' 2016 presidential campaign, together with Russia's FSB security service, the successor to the KGB.
The skills of Russian hackers today developed from a tradition of excellent computing and programming skills dating back to the Soviet era.
""The whole structure of the economy was skewed towards the military sector,"" said Oleg Demidov, a consultant at the Moscow-based independent think-tank PIR Center. 
""All the achievements of Soviet science including the first computers went to serve the military sector.""
The most brilliant students were pushed to work in the military and space sector, he added.
- Banking crime -
After the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, its armed forces were broken up and most of the top specialists turned to the nascent banking sector in Russia, either to work there or to attack it.
In this era saw the first cyber attacks on banking operations and the first mentions of Russian hackers.
""Now Russian hackers are excellently trained and equipped and they still occupy one of the top positions in banking crime,"" said Demidov -- even if the Russian justice system has begun to crack down on them.
In 2016, Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky estimated that between 2012 and 2015, Russian hackers had stolen at least $790 million worldwide.
Russian computer scientists study at ""very strong universities in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Kazan or Krasnoyarsk"", said Denis Kuskov of TelecomDaily specialised research agency.
They ""can work anywhere in the world, in any international company,"" he added. 
In recent years, however, more have opted to stay in Russia, he said. ""The secret services have grown more interested in good programmers and it's easier for them to find work in Russia now.""
In 2012, the Russian defence ministry announced it was creating its own ""cyber troops"". It launched a wide recruitment drive that included promotional videos on social media.
For Demidov, the growing wave of attacks attributed to Russian hackers has come about as Russia becomes better able to defend its own cyber security more strongly, the military sphere included.
""These efforts... have began to bring results,"" he said.
Today however, even the most established players in Russian IT are in the sights of the West.
The US in 2017 imposed a ban on the use of Kaspersky's anti-virus software by federal agencies amid concerns about the company's links to the Russian intelligence services.
While many young Russians may choose to work for the military and secret services for reasons of patriotism, some may still be more interested by the money.
This week a military tribunal in Moscow held a closed-doors trial for the head of operational control at the FSB's centre for information security, Colonel Sergei Mikhalkov and three alleged accomplices.
Kommersant daily reported that they were accused of passing secrets on the Russian secret services' cyber technology to the FBI in return for $10 million.",https://www.securityweek.com/russias-hackers-long-tied-military-secret-services
73,APT28,"Adobe to Patch Flash Zero-Day Exploited by Russian Attackers

Adobe announced on Wednesday that it expects to release a patch for the recently disclosed Flash Player zero-day exploited in targeted attacks by a Russian threat group during the week of October 19.
According to the company, the critical vulnerability (CVE-2015-7645) affects Flash Player 19.0.0.207 and earlier for Windows and Mac, and 11.2.202.535 and earlier 11.x versions for Linux. Adobe noted in its advisory that it’s aware of limited, targeted attacks exploiting the flaw.
The existence of the security hole was brought to light on Tuesday, shortly after Adobe released a Flash Player update that addressed 13 issues.
Researchers at Trend Micro discovered the vulnerability while analyzing the operations of the Russian threat actor Pawn Storm (also known as APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Sofacy and Tsar Team).
The group, which is believed to be linked to the Russian government, has been exploiting the Flash Player zero-day in attacks aimed at several Ministries of Foreign Affairs from all over the world. The attackers lured their victims to websites hosting the exploit via spear phishing emails that used suicide car bombings in Kabul, airstrikes in Syria and Gaza, and other military-related topics as a lure.
Researchers have pointed out that the URLs used by the APT group were similar to the ones spotted earlier this year in attacks aimed at the White House and NATO members.
The cyber espionage actor, which has been around since at least 2007, has targeted military, government, media, and defense organizations from across the world.
Pawn Storm has used six zero-day vulnerabilities in the last year, Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, told SecurityWeek on Tuesday. This includes Java, Windows, and Flash Player zero-days, including some of the exploits leaked as a result of the breach suffered earlier this year by the Italian spyware maker Hacking Team.",https://www.securityweek.com/adobe-patch-flash-zero-day-exploited-russian-attackers
74,APT28,"Denmark Says Russia Hacked Defense Ministry Emails

Denmark on Monday denounced Moscow's ""aggressive"" behavior after a report accused Russian hackers of infiltrating the defense ministry's email accounts.
""This is part of a continuing war from the Russian side in this field, where we are seeing a very aggressive Russia,"" Defense Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen told Danish news agency Ritzau.
A report published Sunday by the Centre for Cyber Security accused a group of pro-Kremlin hackers of breaking into the emails of defense ministry employees in 2015 and 2016.
""The hacked emails don't contain military secrets, but it is of course serious,"" Frederiksen said.
The report identified the hacker group as APT28, also known as Pawn Storm, Sofacy and Fancy Bear, which has links to the Russian government and security services and has previously been named by the FBI and US Homeland Security as being behind ""malicious cyber activity"" against US government bodies.
The group is also believed to be behind other high-profile cyber attacks.
In Denmark, the Centre for Cyber Security said earlier this year that the threat against Danish authorities and companies remained ""very high"".",https://www.securityweek.com/denmark-says-russia-hacked-defense-ministry-emails
75,APT28,"French Presidential Candidate Targeted by Russia-Linked Hackers

A notorious cyber espionage group linked to the Russian government has targeted the political party of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, according to a report published on Tuesday by Trend Micro.
The news comes shortly after Macron won the first round of France’s presidential election. Many believe he will become the county’s next president after he was endorsed by several top politicians, including former opponents in the presidential race.
Trend Micro’s report describes the activities of the threat actor known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium. Researchers have identified tens of military, government, defense, media, political, religious, educational and international organizations targeted by the group.
An analysis of the phishing domains used by the hackers suggests that one of the targets was Macron’s campaign. The attackers registered the domain onedrive-en-marche.fr, which is similar to en-marche.fr, the official website of Marcon’s En Marche! party, likely in an effort to get users to hand over their credentials.
Macron’s campaign has confirmed for The Wall Street Journal that staffers received phishing emails, but claimed the hacking attempts had failed. The National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) also confirmed the attacks, but refused to comment on their origin, Reuters reported.
A representative of En Marche! has accused Russia of interfering with the elections in an effort to help pro-Moscow candidates, but Russia has denied any involvement in the hacker attacks.
According to Trend Micro, the En Marche phishing site was set up in mid-March. The security firm also discovered a phishing domain apparently set up to target the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) political foundation in Germany. The KAS phishing site, named kassap.de, was created in early April.
Last year, Trend Micro also reported seeing a Pawn Storm attack aimed at Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, the political party of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Pawn Storm’s political operations have made a lot of headlines, particularly after the group targeted organizations affiliated with the Democratic Party in the United States. The U.S. officially accused Russia of launching the cyberattacks, and authorities confirmed recently that an investigation is underway to determine if the attacks had an impact on this year’s presidential elections.
Trend Micro pointed out in its report that Pawn Storm has often relied on so-called false flag operations. Individuals and groups claiming to be hacktivists have taken credit for several of the attacks attributed to Pawn Storm.
For instance, an individual using the online moniker Guccifer 2.0 has taken credit for the Democratic Party attacks, and a group calling itself Fancy Bears claimed to have been behind the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Several other “hacktivist” groups have been connected to Pawn Storm, including Cyber Caliphate, which claimed to be linked to ISIS when it attacked the U.S. Army and French TV station TV5Monde back in 2015.

76,APT28,"Industry Reactions to U.S. Indicting 12 Russians for DNC Hack

The U.S. last week indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers over their alleged role in a hacking operation targeting the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
The charges, part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s attempt to interfere in the presidential election, were announced just days before President Donald Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
Industry professionals have commented on the charges, their impact, the possible threat actors responsible for the operation, and how these types of attacks can be avoided.

77,APT28,"Vermont Utility Refutes Reports of Russia Hacking U.S. Electric Grid

U.S. officials told the press that Russia hacked into the country’s electric grid, but the affected utility said it had only found malware on one device that was not connected to the grid.
The Washington Post on Saturday cited anonymous U.S. officials claiming that Russian hackers breached the electric grid. The article, titled “Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electric grid through a utility in Vermont,” led to several politicians making alarming statements on Russia and hackers.
The Vermont utility referenced by The Washington Post, the Burlington Electric Department, published a statement refuting the claims.
Last week, just as the Obama administration announced retaliation against Russia over the presidential election cyberattacks, the DHS and the FBI published a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) to detail the tools and infrastructure used by Russian civilian and military intelligence services in attacks aimed at networks and endpoints associated with the election and various other government, political, and private sector entities.
This malicious activity, dubbed by the U.S. government “Grizzly Steppe,” included attacks launched by two well-known Russia-linked threat groups tracked as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team) and APT29 (aka Cozy Bear and CozyDuke).
However, security experts have criticized the U.S. government for failing to provide strong evidence that Russia did in fact attempt to interfere with the presidential election. Furthermore, some warned that the indicators of compromise (IoC) provided in the JAR are low quality and could lead to false positives.
After the Grizzly Steppe report was published, Burlington Electric conducted a scan of all its computers in an effort to determine if any devices had been infected with Grizzly Steppe malware. Suspicious Internet traffic was detected on a single computer, which had not been connected to the electric grid.
“There is no indication that either our electric grid or customer information has been compromised,” the Vermont utility stated. “Media reports stating that Burlington Electric was hacked or that the electric grid was breached are false.”
“Federal officials have indicated that this specific type of Internet traffic also has been observed elsewhere in the country and is not unique to Burlington Electric. It’s unfortunate that an official or officials improperly shared inaccurate information with one media outlet, leading to multiple inaccurate reports around the country,” it added.
The Washington Post has rewritten its story, clarifying that authorities had not actually found any evidence that the grid had been breached. However, experts say even the new headline, “Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security,” is FUD.


On the other hand, many experts believe the U.S. power grid is vulnerable to cyberattacks.
“Based on existing intelligence, it is reasonable to assume that nation-states already possess all the information they need to launch such an attack on the U.S. power grid - they choose not to because of political implications,” Tim Layton, chief intelligence officer at SurfWatch Labs, said in a SecurityWeek column. “I also believe the USA possesses the same capabilities. It isn't just nation-states that we need to be concerned with, as radical terrorist groups are highly motivated to bring harm to the American people and economy.”
While there is no evidence of destructive cyberattacks on the U.S. electric grid, such attacks have been launched in Ukraine. The Russian government is believed to be responsible for the December 2015 attack that caused severe power outages, and a recent incident may have also been caused by a cyberattack.

78,APT28,"Russian Cyberspies Use Updated Arsenal to Attack Defense Contractors

A Russia-linked cyber espionage group has been using new tools in attacks against defense contractors and other high profile targets, Kaspersky Lab reported on Friday.
The threat actor, known as Pawn Storm, Strontium, APT28, Sofacy, Sednit and Fancy Bear, has been actively targeting military, media, defense and government organizations from across the world since 2007. Entities in NATO countries have been primarily targeted, but researchers recently spotted an increase in attacks aimed at Ukraine.
Pawn Storm has been known to use zero-day exploits targeting Adobe Flash Player, Java, Microsoft Office and Windows in its operations. The attackers have also leveraged a wide range of tools to achieve their goals, including backdoors such as SPLM (also known as Xagent and CHOPSTICK) and AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI and EVILTOSS), and USB stealers designed for data theft from air-gapped systems. Implants dubbed JHUHUGIT and JKEYSKW have also been observed in Pawn Storm attacks.
Up until August, Pawn Storm leveraged zero-day exploits to infect systems with JHUHUGIT and JKEYSKW first-stage implants. However, in August, Kaspersky Lab researchers spotted a new version of the AZZY Trojan, which is mainly used for reconnaissance, while investigating a wave of attacks aimed at defense organizations. Experts said the campaign was still ongoing in November.
The new AZZY, most recently seen in an October attack, had been delivered by another piece of malware instead of a zero-day exploit. An analysis of the threat revealed that unlike previous variants, the new AZZY backdoor has been using an external library for command and control (C&C) communications.
“In the past, the Sofacy developers modified earlier AZZY backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking,” Kaspersky researchers noted in a blog post.
Pawn Storm has also updated its data theft tools. The spy group’s USB stealer modules, used for stealing data from isolated networks, were first updated in February 2015 and the latest versions appear to have been compiled in May 2015, Kaspersky said. Older versions of USBStealer malware were analyzed by researchers at ESET in November 2014.
The USBStealer compiled in May is designed to monitor the infected device for USB drives and collect specified files from them. The files are copied to a hidden folder from where they can be exfiltrated using the AZZY backdoor.
“Two recurring characteristics of the Sofacy group that we keep seeing in its attacks are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packages for extreme resilience,” researchers said. “In the past, the group used droppers that installed both the SPLM and AZZY backdoors on the same machine. If one of them was detected, the other one provided the attacker with continued access.”
Pawn Storm also appears to be interested in Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, a plane that crashed in July 2014 after being hit by a Russian-made missile while flying over a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Trend Micro reported in October that the attackers targeted organizations tasked with investigating the incident.",https://www.securityweek.com/russian-cyberspies-use-updated-arsenal-attack-defense-contractors
