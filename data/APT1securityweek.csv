0,APT1,"'Operation Oceansalt' Reuses Code from Chinese Group APT1

A recently observed cyber-espionage campaign targeting South Korea, the United States and Canada is reusing malicious code previously associated with state-sponsored Chinese group APT1, McAfee reports.
Exposed in a Mandiant report in 2013 and also known as Comment Crew, APT1 was thought to be a unit of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and was considered both one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors and highly prolific in terms of the quantity of information it had stolen.
The newly observed campaign is unlikely the work of APT1, which has remained silent ever since the Mandiant report half a decade ago. Previously, the group had launched cyber-attacks on more than 141 U.S. companies from 2006 to 2010.
Dubbed Oceansalt, the malware implant used in the new campaign shows code similarities with a tool employed by APT1, namely Seasalt. This means that the actor behind the new operation had direct access to Comment Crew’s source code, although it was never made public.
McAfee’s report (PDF) on Oceansalt doesn’t provide a clear answer on who is behind these attacks, but notes that the code overlap could suggest that another group had access to the original code, or that it is a case of code-sharing between actors. Of course, it could also be a “false flag” operation.
McAfee’s security researchers discovered that Oceansalt was launched in five attack waves adapted to the targets.
While the first two attacks were spearfishing-based and used malicious Korean-language Microsoft Excel documents to download the implant, the third switched to Microsoft Word documents instead. Waves four and five targeted a small number of entities outside of South Korea, including the U.S. and Canada.
During the attacks, the hackers used multiple command and control (C&C) servers, showing that the campaign is active in countries such as Canada, Costa Rica, the United States, and the Philippines.
Oceansalt and Seasalt, McAfee notes, not only contain two exact same strings (Upfileer and Upfileok), but also show similarities in command handler and index table, and execute their capabilities in the same way. Furthermore, both use the exact same response codes to indicate the success or failure of command execution.
Both implants use the same codes for drive and file reconnaissance, and for the creation of reverse-shells (which are based on cmd.exe). Unlike Seasalt, however, Oceansalt uses an encoding and decoding mechanism, and a hardcoded control server address, but employs no persistence method.
According to McAfee, evidence that suggests code-sharing between Oceansalt authors and Comment Crew include the different mechanism for getting the C&C IP addresses, as well as the lack of reverse-shell capability in some Oceansalt samples, the presence of debug strings in Oceansalt, and the presence of new functions in one Oceansalt variant.
The implant, the researchers reveal, packs a broad range of capabilities to capture data from the victims’ machines, but it is only a first-stage component, with additional stages downloaded through commands. The malware, however, provides operators with the ability to perform various actions on the system.
Oceansalt includes support for a dozen commands: extract drive information, send information about a specific file, execute a command line using WinExec(), delete file, create file, get information on the running processes, terminate process, create/operate/terminate reverse shell, and test receive and send capabilities.
“Our research shows that Comment Crew’s malware in part lives on in different forms employed by another advanced persistent threat group operating primarily against South Korea. This research represents how threat actors including nation-states might collaborate on their campaigns,” McAfee concludes.

1,APT1,"Lessons from Mandiant’s APT1 Report

Last week Mandiant released a powerful report that exposed what certainly appears to be a state-sponsored hacking initiative from China, dubbed by Mandiant as APT1. If you haven’t already, I highly encourage you to read the full report available here. The report not only provides analysis of the organization behind the attacks, but also includes a wealth of detail into specific techniques used by the groups as well as indicators that you can use in your own security practices.
In this article I will summarize some of the key indicators as well as some of the techniques that may help you find other indicators of advanced attacks in your network.
3,000 Indicators
It was certainly heartwarming to see Mandiant release a large number of very specific indicators of APT1 that security teams can put to good use. Far too often, a security vendor will report about how they uncovered a breach, but often lack the details that would help real infosec professionals to better do their job.
In this report, Mandiant has done the industry a solid by disclosing a variety of very specific indicators that they have been able to tie to APT1, including domains used by the attacking infrastructure, SSL certificates used to encrypt the attacker’s traffic, MD5 hashes of APT1 malware and a variety of other open-source “indicators of compromise”.
This provides very actionable information, but information that we all have to realize will also very short-lived. Given the sophistication of the APT1 organization, it’s quite likely that the referenced domains, hashes and certificates that were exposed have been decommissioned or will be soon. The indicators of compromise delve more deeply into the techniques of the attackers as opposed to certs and domain, which are effectively disposable.
Patterns and Techniques
Beyond the easily identifiable indicators, the Mandiant report provided insight into the lifecycle of an APT1 attack from the initial infection, escalation and ongoing theft of data.
First, as one might expect, APT1 used highly targeted spear-phishing techniques to infect a target, which included creating fake email accounts in the name of someone that the target would recognize. Secondly, the infecting files were often zipped to avoid analysis and often contained executables designed to look like pdfs.
This provides two important lessons – one technical and one practical. First, it means that when looking for advanced malware, we absolutely must look within zipped payloads. But secondly, it destroys the all-to-common idea of malware infections being the source of the “stupid user”. That’s not to say that “stupid users” don’t exist and that they don’t lead to malware infections – they certainly do on both counts. But the point is rather that highly targeted phishing can be constructed to fool even savvy well-trained users, and we can’t rely on training to solve the problem on its own. Instead, we need to proactively test and analyze content to programmatically determine if it is malicious or benign.
The report also shared that once the infection was established, the attackers would often rely on RDP (remote desktop protocol) to administer the ongoing attack. This protocol is obviously highly common on enterprise networks and allows the attacker to control the compromised machine remotely. RDP has been strongly linked to advanced attacks shared in a variety of other reports, including this year’s Verizon Data Breach Report. The lesson here is pretty clear – RDP and related protocols are one of the key tools of persistent attacks and security teams to have strict control over RDP, limiting its use to only the few users who must have it, and requiring two-factor authentication for RDP users.
APT1 also used a myriad of techniques to hide its communications with command-and-control servers. This included sharing data via HTTP, custom protocols written by the attackers, and a variety of modified protocols designed to look like normal application traffic, such as MSN Messenger, Gmail Calendar, and Jabber (a protocol used in a variety of instant messaging applications). All of these traffics were often used in conjunction with SSL to further obscure the traffic. This again highlights the need to look within SSL-encrypted traffic as well as the need to find customized traffic and unusual traffic that deviates from protocol. This is an emerging art, but certainly possible using firewalls and threat prevention solutions that finely decode network and application protocols.
Once it was time to steal data, the attackers predominantly relied on FTP. As with the infecting file, exfiltrated data was often compressed, this time mostly with RAR. FTP is very popular with malware because it is small, flexible and often allowed in networks. However, security teams should remember to closely analyze FTP and certainly take a closer look at FTP used to transport RAR files.
Learn to See What Doesn’t Belong
While the Mandiant report is incredibly illuminating, it is also not a panacea. If anything, the more we learn about sophisticated attacks the more it is obvious that security products will never be enough without security skill. Certainly, we will continue to need and use signatures and systems that can automatically block the bad things on our networks. But it is also equally clear that this alone won’t be enough. We need to actively seek out and test the unknowns in our network, whether that is anomalous traffic or unknown, potentially malicious files.
We need to know the application fingerprint of our networks and users so that we can see when something is amiss. Security is fast becoming the front-lines for enterprises and one of the most strategic roles in any organization, but it requires us to be actively and intellectually engaged. That is a daunting task, but one we can meet.",https://www.securityweek.com/lessons-mandiant%E2%80%99s-apt1-report
2,APT1,"Lockheed: Attackers Went Quiet After APT1 Report Exposed Chinese Hackers


Lockheed Martin Says Attackers Went Quiet After Mandiant's APT1 Report Called Out Chinese Cyber Spies
Threat actors targeting Lockheed Martin immediately halted their cyberattacks against the defense contractor following the release of Mandiant’s APT1 report, Lockheed executives said Wednesday.
In February 2013, Mandiant released its bold, unprecedented report that made direct allegations and exposed a multi-year, massive cyber state-sponsored espionage campaign from a unit of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
The threat actor group, dubbed APT1 by FireEye-owned Mandiant, is alleged to be one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors, which the security firm claims has “systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data” from at least 141 organizations.
However, as Mandiant explained in a follow-up report released in May 2013, the threat actors immediately began curtailing their attacks after being called out and began to shift techniques, something that Lockheed witnessed in its own environment. 
“Since the Mandiant report came out, we saw an immediate decrease in attacks,” Charles “Charlie” Croom, VP of Cyber Strategy and Government Relations at Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions, told SecurityWeek. “I think all our strategic partners saw that,” he said.
Speaking to SecurityWeek at the company’s Global Vision Center in Arlington, Virginia, Croom said the adversary that Mandiant exposed was one that a number of companies, including Lockheed Martin, had been tracking for over a year. “We were familiar with this adversary, and were familiar with their tactics and procedures,” he said.
“Because of the characteristics of the attacks, and who they are attacking, we know who the team is,” Croom said.
While Mandiant’s report was met with criticism by some, particularly around the challenges of attribution, it’s clear that the report had a significant impact and triggered a reaction from the alleged state sponsored threat actors.
“We’re glad Mandiant stood up,” Croom said.
“[The report] was a trigger point”, Darrell Durst, VP of Cyber Solutions at Lockheed Martin, said during a panel discussion at the Lockheed Martin Defense and Intelligence Technology Media Summit on Wednesday. “Things were dying down even before the report came out, but you could clearly see a shift in actions.”
Targeting Suppliers
While not necessarily as a result of the APT1 report, Croom, who while in the U.S. Air Force served as Director of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and Commander of the Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations, said that Lockheed’s hardened IT security infrastructure is forcing some attackers to find other means to attack.
“The good news is that they are not attacking Lockheed Martin any more because we are too hard, so they are going to our suppliers,” he said.
“The threat over the last ten years has gotten extremely aggressive,” Durst said. “[Attackers] are actually being very strategic in where it is that they want to get the information and how they are going to go about doing that.”
“They will wait,” Durst said, adding that attackers will take their time in order to get in and achieve their objectives.
“They will go to a supplier who has the connection to Lockheed Martin from an IT perspective, or even in a sharing of documentation,” Durst said.
While Durst says the defense giant has been successful in thwarting a number of attackers, he said new adversaries with new techniques continue to emerge and campaigns continue to increase.
“We have seen a number of the adversaries gone quiet,” he said. “I think we have successfully been able to counter a number of adversaries relative to our networks.""
While some attackers may have gone quiet, the company does not believe they have gone away for good, but have rather shifted tactics.
“Even if it were two years, that’s not necessarily an indication that they have gone away,” Durst said.
“We are assuming they are taking a different approach,” said Tim Reardon, Vice President and General Manager Lockheed’s Defense & Intelligence Solutions group.
While Lockheed did not specify the tactics used against them by the APT1 attackers, Mandiant’s report explained that the group used highly targeted spear-phishing techniques to infect a target, which included creating fake email accounts in the name of someone that the target would recognize.
When asked if they were able to trace the attacks back to China, Croom reiterated the company’s policy of non-attribution.
“We’re interested more in their attributes, and how their attributes can reveal them coming into our network so that we can spot them and kick them out.”

3,APT1,"Unit In China's PLA Behind Massive Cyber Espionage Operation: Report

APT1: Mandiant Exposes One of China's Most Active Cyber Espionage Units
In a fascinating, unprecedented, and statistics-packed report, security firm Mandiant made direct allegations and exposed a multi-year, massive cyber espionage campaign that they say with confidence is the work of China, more specifically, a unit of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
Mandiant has named the attack group “APT1”, what is likely a government-sponsored group that is one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors, and considered to be one of the most prolific in terms of quantity of information it has stolen.
To further its claims that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant also revealed three “personas” that they say are associated with APT1 attacks.
According to Mandiant’s investigations, APT1 has taken hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across many industries going as far back as 2006, but representing just a small fraction of the overall cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted.
It was the massive scale and impact of APT1's operations that compelled Mandiant to write and publically release the report.
Historically, Mandiant has said there was no way to determine the extent of China’s involvement in many attacks, but the firm now says it has enough evidence to confidently say that “the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.”
While many firms steer away from publicly calling out China as a culprit in cyber attacks, Mandiant is taking a stance and boldly pointing fingers at China, and bringing many statistics and research to back its case.
Mandiant believes APT1 is the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General staff Department’s (GSD) 3rd Department, commonly known by its Military unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398.
The security firm estimates that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, or even thousands of people, and that China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit. Additionally, Mandiant said that it conservatively estimates that APT1’s current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers across dozens of countries.
Mandiant said that it was able to confirm 937 command and control servers running on 849 distinct IP addresses and has confirmed 2,551 domain names attributed to APT1 in the last several years.
“Our research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of  China is tasking the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft against organizations around the world,” the report alleged.
When APT1 launches an attack against a target, it’s typically not a one shot deal or a quick hit. In fact, according to Mandiant’s research, APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days. The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim’s network was four years and ten months.
In one operation, Mandiant witnessed APT1 steal 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. APT1’s targets include organizations across a broad range of industries, mainly in the United States and other English-speaking countries.

In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant witnessed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simplified Chinese language.
“Once the group establishes access to a victim’s network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years  to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim organizations’ leadership,” the report explained.
Hacking For Economic Gain and Advantage
Mandiant’s investigations show that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan, and warns that any industry related to China’s strategic priorities are potential attack targets.
Mandiant highlighted an attack in 2008 that compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. According to Mandiant, over the next two and a half years, APT1 used various tools to steal an unknown number of files from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the conpany's CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities, Mandiant said.
China continues to deny claims
As usual, China denied that its Army had supported any kind of hacking activity.
""Not only are reports that China's army has been involved in hacking unprofessional, they do not fit with the facts,"" China's defense ministry said in a statement to AFP. ""Hacking attacks are a global problem. Like other countries, China also faces the threat of hacking attacks, and is one of the main countries falling victim to hacking attacks.""
China’s foreign ministry also reminded that China was itself a major victim, saying that most overseas cyberattacks against it originate in the US.
Recent attacks against several high-profile US media outlets, Including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Bloomberg, as well as against Twitter and others, have further raised concerns over Chinese hackers.
In late January, The New York Times said hackers stole corporate passwords and targeted the computers of 53 employees including former Beijing bureau chief Jim Yardley, who is now the South Asia bureau chief at the Times based in India, after the newspaper published a report on the vast wealth amassed by Premier Wen Jiabao's family.
Mandiant was hired to investigate the attacks against The Times. 
While Mandiant hopes its efforts will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering targeted cyber attacks, it also acknowledged that releasing this report has put itself somewhat at risk.
“We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us,” Mandiant noted. “We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism.”
In addition to the detailed report, Mandiant provided more than 3,000 APT1 indicators of compromise, including domain names, IP addresses, X.509 encryption certificates and MD5 hashes of malware used by APT1's attackers, in order to help organizations identify and defend against APT1 operations.
The full report from Mandiant can be found here (PDF), and the Appendix and 3,000+ APT1 Indicators can be found here (.zip). Mandiant also provided a video showing actual APT1 activity which is embedded below.
This report is likely to be one of the most important reports of the year and should be required reading for any information security professional—or if it were up to me, everyone within an organization.

4,APT1,"China's APT1 Changing Tactics, Rebuilding: Mandiant

It appears the Chinese cyber-espionage crew behind attacks on as many as 100 businesses is cutting back on some of its attacks and looking for alternative tools, Mandiant said.
Back in February, Mandiant released a 74-page report with loads of information on the group, dubbed APT1, including its attack methods, operational methodology, and organizations it had previously infiltrated. The report accused APT1 of retrieving hundreds of terabytes of stolen data. Even if APT1 wasn't an official entity within the Chinese government, the report made a strong case that the government was at least aware of its operations.

Since the publication of the report, the group may have had to change some of its methods, Mandiant said in a follow-up report this week. The original report included more than 3,000 APT1 indicators used by APT1, including domain names, 832 IP addresses, 13 digital certificates used to encrypt data, and MD5 hashes of over malware. Recent analysis indicates they are still active, but they are changing their methods.
""APT1 is still active using a well-coordinated and well-defined attack methodology against a wide set of industries -- with a discernible post-report shift towards new tools and infrastructure,"" wrote Dan Mcwhorter, Mandiant's managing director for threat intelligence.
The report was the first time a private sector company had laid out evidence to link the China to cyber-espionage campaigns against businesses and government entities around the world.
APT1 relied on social engineering methods, remote access tools, and more than 40 malware families to carry out their operations, the original report said. The report's goal was to make it harder to the group to carry out their attacks and slow them down, since organizations now knew what to look for in their logs and network traffic. It appears to have had some effect, as the information ""hindered APT1's operations,"" Mcwhorter wrote.
""APT1 has stopped using the vast majority of the infrastructure that was disclosed with the release of the indicators,"" Mcwhorter wrote.
The group has not been knocked out yet, as it probably still has access to an extensive infrastructure of computers around the world. While there was speculation that Mandiant's publication of APT1 indicators would have resulted in the group dismantling itself, the follow-up reports indicates that is not the case.
Mandiant noted that APT1 is only one of more than 20 Advanced Persistent Threat groups operating out of China that the company is aware of. Mandiant's report disrupted only APT1, not the others.
""Mandiant has observed no significant changes in their operations,"" the follow-up report said.

5,APT1,"Chinese Whispers, Chinese Lies: Analyzing Mandiant's APT1 Report

In the weeks since the Mandiant APT1 Report was released, the conclusions presented by Mandiant have been extensively repeated and commented on by pretty much everyone. Worryingly, the narrative was accepted almost unequivocally, brushing aside many inconsistencies and disregarding any opposing interpretations. In the case of most of the commentators, it appeared they had either only briefly skipped through or not even read the original report.
What struck me and many others as most suspicious, were the glaring operational security lapses that this supposedly “highly professional” hacking group seems to have made over the course of several years. Most obvious is the continued use of the “hugesoft.org” domain name.

We are meant to believe that a covert, special operations team member was allowed to bring with him a tainted domain from his civilian, cybercrime days. What that would indicate is that in this vast, huge group (Mandiant alleges several hundred or even thousands) no one knows anything about operational security procedures, such as executing regular reviews for example, that would and should have eventually made the Comment Crew themselves aware of these smoking guns. The group evidently has sufficient knowhow and is able to use OSINT to construct targeted attacks and provide them with situational awareness to operate, yet appears to be unable to cover their tracks.
We are also told that APT1 was so careless or brazen, depending on the interpretation, that they habitually entered partially correct information for domain registration data, even using email addresses that could be Google’d or traced using OSINT methods. Not consistently though – only sometimes. At other times, they made them up.
The analysis of the WHOIS records by Mandiant was hilarious. On Page 47 (PDF), we are treated to the ludicrous assumption that the spelling, of all things, of the fake registry information is of any consequence. All it shows is that whoever did it did not care about the accuracy of the contents of a fake dns registration. Because it’s fake, duh. Mandiant’s conclusion is again, comical:
Uncoordinated DNS registration campaign – where some registrants fabricated fake data and others did not. What is that even supposed to mean? An “uncoordinated campaign” is something of an oxymoron anyway.
The report lists many domains that were spotted by Mandiant. The only problem is that they are consolidated, and not listed or sorted in any way that allow a 3rd party to recognize in which context, constellation and grouping they were actually originally identified. This is disingenuous, because it means that it is not transparent whether the attribution of all of these to one individual group is correct, or if there were other patterns within the individual incidents. Essentially, the veracity of the claim that all of these domains belong to one group is something we have seen no actual evidence for. It is based solely on word of mouth. Of course, many of these can be verified by other 3rd parties, and has been done, but not all of them together. That can give the false impression that the Indicators of Compromise have been verified.
The indicators tying the Comment Crew to PLA Group 61398 are also tenuous, so tenuous that if you plucked them with your finger, they would probably tear. The Information on PLA Group 61398 is undisputable. There is absolutely no doubt that this group exists. What is in question however, is that the group identified (although even the evidence that the activity is solely of one group is questionable) as the Comment Crew are in fact one and the same. Mandiant provides nothing in hard evidence, instead stringing together coincidences and leaps of logic that would seem more at home on a conspiracy forum.
Most of the characteristics that match (Page 59, Table 12, Matching Characteristics) between APT1 and Unit 61398 would apply almost to any active Hacking Group. It is like identifying a murderer by saying that murderers have 2 arms, 2 legs, and kill people, hence so-and-so did it.
Even the geographical attribution is unreliable in the sense that there could be other hacking groups acting in such a vast and populated area, that has a population of over 5 million, is home to several thousand businesses and 2 universities. In the same vein, you could attribute any hack originating in London to the UK Ministry of Defense.
These are the main points that the entire synopsis of the Mandiant Report hinges on. It is also worth pointing out that many of the subsequent conclusions are based on huge leaps of faith and many assumptions. In addition, much of the report is filled with information and OSINT sources that only corroborate and strengthen the evidence for the existence of the Comment Crew, and the existence of PLA Unit 61398, but not that they are indeed one and the same.
There is one secondary indicator that has been made a great deal of. On page 52, the report cites an incident involving the actor identified as “Ugly Gorilla” in 2004, who asked a prominent Professor whether China had a “cyber army”. Whilst an interesting find, it really proves very little in the way of any association between “Ugly Gorilla” and the PLA, but keep a mental note of it, as we will revisit it later.
I am a great believer in the principle of Occam’s Razor. Whatever hypothesis makes the least assumptions is the most likely. Applying that to many of the findings in the Mandiant Report and the narrative that was provided as an explanation seems prone to relying on too many assumptions.
The problems identified with the report have not been entirely overlooked. Considering the obvious lapses in operational security that the alleged Comment Crew displayed even Mandiant has conceded in the meantime that the Crew is not China’s “A-Team”. No kidding, Sherlock! It is in fact well known that China has some operational offensive cyber-teams of a high caliber. In this of course, they are not alone. According to Mandiant:
Applying Occam’s razor here again: Why would the Chinese have these elite groups that appear to work without leaving anywhere near as many traces, and then instead let the B-List go on a rampage doing most of the work? Even if it is argued that it is a matter of resources, it seems unlikely that these teams would not, over time, train the others, or that Operational Security Procedures, Tools and Knowhow would be shared.
When pressed if the Comment Crew were more “regimented” than a group of freelancers, Richard Bejtlich, the CEO of Mandiant retorts, “Other units are more regimented and have better opsec [or operational security,] and that’s why we didn’t talk about them.”
It seems just a little bit as though Mandiant caught a Minnow, and back at the pub with each telling the arms go wider apart taking on the size of a pike. Not to trivialize the damage done, but one needs to keep in mind that the Comment Crew in particular used a lot of off-the-shelf tools and relied far less on 0days than the more sophisticated groups, not to mention the less than stellar OpSec, leaving a trail like bull in a China shop (obligatory pun intended).
Even latest finding, of old blog entries from an individual purported to be a member of PLA Group 61398 and the Comment Crew, whilst sounding plausible at first glance makes you scratch your head in wonderment once you think about it. How was it possible that this individual was able to post this information on a public blog for so many years, without arousing the attention of his colleagues, superiors, or any of the other various organs of the Peoples Party that otherwise monitor and censor all else. Even project details are disclosed. There are examples of information being censored for far less.
This is the problem when you are trying to match the evidence against a foregone conclusion. We like to compare this to solving a jigsaw puzzle, which is a bad analogy. You always know what a jigsaw puzzle looks like before, and just try to fit the pieces to make that picture. This is more like a riddle, where you are given clues that are meant to lead to the answer. I am not in any way saying that the good folks at Mandiant are up to anything sinister or are colluding with anyone , far from that. The release of the Indicators of Compromise were a boon to the entire community, and their technical ability is undoubtedly of the highest quality and caliber. But we are all human and cannot overcome our personal and innate preconceptions and preconceived notions. The technical work was excellent-- the drawing of conclusions less so.
There are far too many assumptions there for it to be the most likely explanation. Occam’s razor states that these guys are not military grade. That is the only possible conclusion based on all the evidence there currently is.
The foremost problem with the Mandiant report is that it relies on a view of China and the Chinese Cyber-Operations that has very little to do with situational conditions on the ground. It clings on to the stereotype of a regimented, centralized China with total top down control. If that China ever existed, that is certainly not the case now.
If you have followed the news and reports coming out from China the past years, and especially the last months, you will have heard of widespread governmental and industrial and economic corruption. This corruption is endemic and the main driver behind the prolific hacking. The majority of the hackers are indeed freelancers, paid bonuses and fees for valuable information. There is evidence to support this, with instances of alleged Chinese government operations being found hosted side by side with criminal activities. Once again, a surefire sign that military or intelligence services operational security are not being followed by these kinds of threat actors. The risk of losing operational integrity is too high.
Even the prevailing and popular theory that these freelancers are in the employ of the Chinese government is often incorrect and ignores the scale and specific Chinese character of the corruption. A recent report in the China Digital Times provides a behind the scenes look into how espionage and surveillance are used in internecine infighting in local, regional and possibly even national government, politics, and economics. It is a definite recommended must read. Espionage has become a tool of choice in China when doing business and a common weapon to get ahead in your career.
Essentially, there are many, many parties who will make use of these types of services, the majority of them without any Peoples Party or PLA authority, or even their knowledge. Businesses competing in this environment will also use any means possible to get or stay ahead.
In this environment, hackers can take on contracts from many of the parties participating in this activity, going either after specific targets or information, selling opportunistic pay data to multiple customers, or if the data is valuable enough, to the highest bidder.
What this really means though, is that when the Chinese government states that it is not behind most of these attacks – it is possibly telling the truth. That the Chinese government has offensive cyber capabilities are not disputed – most governments now have these, or are planning on adding them. What is not a given is that all of this activity has been officially prompted or sanctioned.
As well as commercial freelancers plying their trade to anyone willing to pay, there are dedicated groups financed and set up by unsanctioned individuals and interest groups, working specifically to further private interests. The line between government and private interests, due to the innate nature of the power structures in China, are often blurry to the point of being unrecognizable.
One thing to note is that the hacking is also indiscriminate; they target each other as much as international targets.
Add to this the fact that other actors, and other nation states amongst them, use china as a jumping –off point, and the result is pandemonium and chaos. It’s the wild, wild east.
Coming back to the incident with “Ugly Gorilla” and his public query that some have interpreted as the possible first contact between the PLA and UG, it is just as likely that a private entity could have reached out and made contact. Amongst the many OSINT sources dug up so far in regards to the identified members of the Comment Crew, attempts at finding employment seem to figure prominently. That too indicates a burgeoning market for hackers for hire. If it was only the government employing hackers, publicly seeking work would seem moot.
The reason then, why the Comment Crew, and such groups in general, are so successful; have perfected and evolved their infrastructure, techniques and toolsets; have been able to obtain the resources and longevity and maintain their focus in such a way that many observers think they are nation-state sponsored is because they have an economic environment that makes this possible. They are able to convert much of the data they exploit into hard cash and other income, and in a location like the industrial hub Pudong they have quick and easy access to office space, infrastructure, human resources, and as an added bonus occasionally get to rub shoulders with the national intelligence community at lunch. The same environmental factors that make Pudong attractive to the actual PLO Group 61398 would more than likely make it suited for similar operations, be they military and private.
Ron Gula, the CEO of Tenable Network Security, remarked to me recently that it sounded reminiscent of the KGB Hackers, whose story is recounted in Clifford Stoll’s wonderful account of how he traced this group and singlehandedly invented the discipline of computer forensics, “The Cuckoo’s Egg”. The KGB Hackers were primarily a group of German hackers led by Karl Koch acting under the alias Hagbard. They spied for the KGB in the late 1980’s, targeting European and US defense installations and contractors. Supplied with Cash payments and drugs amongst other things by their Russian handlers, they were able to carry out hacks with all of their attention full time. Of course, the people supplying the money need not necessarily be from the government. Anyone with deep pockets and a need for the information available via these means will suffice.
One may argue that my narrative has little evidence – to which I would counter that I have just as much as Mandiant. For that though, mine at least is based on situational awareness and a more realistic set of assumptions. Other commentators have come to similar conclusions as well.
For the Chinese government the problem is that it cannot acknowledge this state of affairs publicly or officially – not just because they may lose face – but also because corruption is such a touchy subject and has become a major problem and social issue in the Peoples Republic. In addition, many of the interest groups that are benefitting from these activities have a stake in the government and judging by other behavior will work against any attempt to limit them.
It remains to be seen if this activity will – or even can – be reined in by the Chinese government. It is questionable how much influence the leadership has on this behavior, or if it can do anything that will be effective at all, when it is so widespread, against intent and without official sanction anyway.
The announced crackdown on corruption by the new leadership may be the best hope and may have more of an impact than targeting the hacking market by itself, should it prove to be a heartfelt attempt and be in any way effective. The danger in the meantime though, is that the incessant offensive activity originating out of Chinese cyberspace, whether state-sponsored or the result of criminals and corruption, will lead to an escalation and a cyber-arms race. Calling for international agreement on offensive operations in cyberspace will do little to curb the shadow activity emanating from China. The government will have to take serious and effective action or the economic repercussions will outweigh any benefits deriving from engaging in espionage, as well as the cost required to control it. It would also have the benefit of reducing the noise that currently allows other actors to use Chinese IP-Space as a decoy to hide their own tracks.
So does this alternative interpretation change anything? Probably not for past, present and future victims. The Modus Operandi remains the same, and the primary concern for them is still damage limitation and the loss of data and competitiveness. But, it is relevant to policy makers and businesses intending on operating in China. It impacts how we have to interact with the Chinese government on this, and should also redefine our expectations.

6,APT1,"China's APT1 Still Operating With the Same Modus Operandi

According to researchers at Cyber Squared, the group APT1, as named by Mandiant earlier this year, is up to their same old tricks. Despite being outed after attacks against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, they have not changed tactics.
Two months ago, the APT1 group (a.k.a. “Comment Crew”) was the center of attention after being named in a Mandiant report. The intelligence firm was called in to investigate the security incidents the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and in a report said that APT1 was the “...2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General staff Department’s (GSD) 3rd Department, commonly known by its Military unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398.”

According to their report, Mandiant said that they were able to confirm 937 C&C servers, running on more than 800 distinct IP addresses. Further, the firm said that APT1 has had more than 2,500 domains attributed to them in the last several years.
“Our research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of  China is tasking the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft against organizations around the world,” Mandiant’s report alleged.
In the aftermath of that news cycle, it was expected that APT1 would disappear, or at the least they would shift gears and change their tactics, tools, and procedures (TPPs). As it turns out, that isn’t the case.
“As of late April 2013, Chinese cyber espionage threat groups have clearly continued their activity. In the example given below, we will highlight that “Comment Crew” is still conducting exploitation operations. In fact, there has been little change,” a blog post by Cyber Squared explains.
While it is possible that the group is also using newer capabilities, the post explains, that they haven’t stopped using the methods they’re known for is concerning. Cyber Squared postulated that the group may have achieved “a satisfactory balance of conducting successful exploitation operations” with their existing infrastructure and methods, while implementing additional evasion techniques.
“The totality of evidence leads us to believe that that “Comment Crew” is still in the game and up to their old tricks, using familiar tactics to target their victims. The February disclosure appears to have done little to stem the onslaught of cyber espionage from this or other Chinese threat groups,” the post concluded.

7,APT1,"FireEye Denies Hacking Back Against Chinese Cyberspies

In his latest book, New York Times correspondent David Sanger describes how cybersecurity firm Mandiant hacked into the devices of Chinese cyberspies during its investigation into the threat group known as APT1.
Mandiant, now owned by FireEye, published its famous report on APT1 back in 2013 when it was led by CEO Kevin Mandia. The company at the time released information apparently showing that the Chinese military had been conducting sophisticated cyber-espionage operations.
In his book, “The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age,” Sanger describes how he was allowed to watch Mandiant hack into the hackers’ systems. An excerpt of Sanger’s book shared on Twitter by Thomas Rid, a Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins University, reads:
In a statement published on Monday, FireEye admitted that Sanger was given access to the methods used by Mandiant to gather evidence of APT1’s ties to the Chinese military, but claims the reporter’s description “resulted in a serious mischaracterization of our investigative efforts.”
“We did not do this, nor have we ever done this,” FireEye said regarding claims that its employees activated the cameras on the hackers’ own laptops. “To state this unequivocally, Mandiant did not employ ‘hack back’ techniques as part of our investigation of APT1, does not ‘hack back’ in our incident response practice, and does not endorse the practice of ‘hacking back.’”
“Hacking back,” the term used to describe a cyberattack victim – or someone hired by the victim – hacking into the systems of the attacker, is a controversial practice and only few cybersecurity firms have admitted doing it.
FireEye claims that what Sanger described as hacking back were actually video recordings of the attackers interacting with their malware command and control (C&C) servers. The firm has published one of the videos it presumably showed the reporter.
“To someone observing this video ‘over the shoulder’ of one of our investigators, it could appear as live system monitoring. Nevertheless, Mandiant did not create these videos through ‘hacking back’ or any hacking activity. All of these videos were made through information obtained via consensual security monitoring on behalf of victim companies that were compromised,” FireEye explained.
While some industry professionals have accepted FireEye’s explanation for obtaining data on the hackers’ personal online activities, Sanger’s claims that he saw APT1 members wearing leather jackets raises a lot of questions. FireEye has not specifically addressed this issue in its statement, but SecurityWeek is trying to obtain some clarifications from the company. In the meantime, experts have provided some more or less plausible explanations on how the reporter may have seen what he believed were the hackers.

Richard Bejtlich, who worked for Mandiant and then FireEye between 2011 and 2017, including as Chief Security Strategist, has corroborated FireEye’s statement.
‘At no time when I worked for Mandiant or FireEye, or afterwards, was there ever a notion that we would hack into adversary systems,” Bejtlich wrote in a blog post. “During my six year tenure, we were publicly and privately a ‘no hack back’ company. I never heard anyone talk about hack back operations. No one ever intimated we had imagery of APT1 actors taken with their own laptop cameras. No one even said that would be a good idea.”

8,APT1,"Researchers Identify Targeted Attacks in Australia

Researchers at FireEye have identified a new targeted attack, currently hitting organizations in Australia, in order to deliver payloads designed to open remote access and steal information.
The malware discovered by FireEye goes to several lengths to remain hidden, and uses a chained process to attack its victim. According to FireEye, the victims in this attack were hand picked, with the opening stage of the attack itself coming via email.
The companies being targeted were selected for unknown reasons, but the attackers are using malicious URLs embedded within the emails that link to a C&C (Command and Control) domain that uses the name of the victim or the name of a current project that is being worked on as an attempt at legitimacy.
Once the victim visits one of the C&C domains, the host revives instructions as “base64 encoded strings using a custom character set, which is further scrambled using a custom-scrambling algorithm,” FireEye reported. 
After that, a base64-encoded executable embedded in an HTML page is downloaded and ran on the host.
“In our experiment, since the CnC was not responding, we supplied an encoded notepad.exe in the response. The malware successfully decoded notepad.exe and launched it as setup.exe on the compromised machine,” FireEye explained.
“We have observed many variants of this malware; some even try sending hostname and IP address information back to its CnC as part of its User-Agent string in the GET request. One of the variants we observed had “IPhone 8.5” in the UA string, which we found interesting.”
It’s worth mentioning that FireEye’s findings included a list of malware that was previously disclosed by Mandiant in their APT1 report. An indexed list of the APT1 malware can be seen here. ",https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-identify-targeted-attacks-australia
9,APT1,"""Dust Storm"" Attackers Target Japanese Critical Infrastructure


Commercial and critical infrastructure organizations in Japan have been targeted in a multi-year campaign dubbed by researchers “Operation Dust Storm.”
A report published on Tuesday by endpoint security firm Cylance details the activities of a threat group that has been active since at least 2010. The attackers have targeted various organizations in Japan, South Korea, the United States, Europe, and several Southeast Asian countries, and in 2015 they started focusing on Japanese organizations.
The actor, which experts believe is a well-funded and well-organized group likely associated with a nation-state, relied on watering holes, spear phishing, unique backdoors and zero-day exploits to conduct reconnaissance and espionage.
According to Cylance, the threat actor has breached the systems of Japanese organizations in the electricity generation, finance, construction, oil and natural gas, and transportation sectors.
Experts reported that early Operation Dust Storm attacks were relatively unsophisticated and they were easily detected by the security industry. The group’s activities attracted the attention of researchers in 2011, when they used Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2011-0611) and Internet Explorer (CVE-2011-1255) zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver a piece of malware dubbed “Misdat.”
In October 2011, the attackers leveraged news surrounding the Libyan crisis and the death of Muammar Gaddafi to target US defense organizations and Uyghurs. The following year, they leveraged another Internet Explorer zero-day (CVE-2012-1889) in their operations.
In March 2013, shortly after Mandiant published a report on the notorious Chinese state-sponsored threat group known as APT1, experts noticed a significant drop in Operation Dust Storm activity until August 2013. Another noteworthy event took place in February 2014, when the actor started using a new Internet Explorer zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322) distributed via a watering hole set up on a software reseller’s website.
In 2015, when it started focusing on Japan, Operation Dust Storm targeted various types of organizations, including an automaker, the Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility firm, and an oil and gas company.
In addition to its previous tools, in May 2015, the group added several Android backdoors to its arsenal. These threats, designed to forward SMS messages and call information to a command and control (C&C) server, were used against victims in South Korea and Japan.
The pieces of malware used in the first attacks were unsophisticated and easy to detect, but the more recent campaigns involved custom threats that largely evaded security products, Cylance said in its report.
“At this time, [Cylance] does not believe the attacks were meant to be destructive or disruptive. However, our team believes that attacks of this nature on companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and are likely to continue to escalate in the future,” Cylance concluded.
