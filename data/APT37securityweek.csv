0,APT37,"North Korean Hacking Group APT37 Expands Targets

A lesser known hacker group believed to be working on behalf of the North Korean government has been expanding the scope and sophistication of its campaigns, according to a report published on Tuesday by FireEye.
The threat actor is tracked by FireEye as APT37 and Reaper, and by other security firms as Group123 (Cisco) and ScarCruft (Kaspersky). APT37 has been active since at least 2012, but it has not been analyzed as much as the North Korea-linked Lazarus group, which is said to be responsible for high-profile attacks targeting Sony and financial organizations worldwide.
Cisco published a report in January detailing some of the campaigns launched by the threat actor in 2017, but APT37 only started making headlines in early February when researchers revealed that it had been using a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player to deliver malware to South Korean users.
APT37, whose goals appear to align with North Korea’s military, political and economic interests, has mainly focused on targeting public and private entities in South Korea, including government, defense, military and media organizations.
However, according to FireEye, the group expanded its attacks to Japan, Vietnam and even the Middle East last year. The list of targets includes organizations in the chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, aerospace, healthcare, and automotive sectors.

One of the targets in the Middle East was a telecommunications services provider that had entered an agreement with the North Korean government. The deal fell through, which is when APT37 started hacking the Middle Eastern company, likely in an effort to collect information, FireEye said.
APT37 has exploited several Flash Player and Hangul Word Processor vulnerabilities to deliver various types of malware, including the RUHAPPY wiper, the CORALDECK exfiltration tool, the GELCAPSULE and HAPPYWORK downloaders, the MILKDROP and SLOWDRIFT launchers, the ZUMKONG infostealer, the audio-capturing tool SOUNDWAVE, and backdoors tracked by FireEye as DOGCALL, KARAE, POORAIM, WINERACK and SHUTTERSPEED.
This malware has been delivered using social engineering tactics, watering holes, and even torrent sites for wide-scale distribution.
FireEye is highly confident that APT37 is linked to the North Korean government based on several pieces of evidence, including the use of a North Korean IP, malware compilation timestamps consistent with a typical workday in North Korea, and objectives that align with Pyongyang’s interests.
“North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms,” FireEye said in its report. “Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.”
Neither Kaspersky nor Cisco have explicitly attributed the APT37 attacks to North Korea.

1,APT37,"Researchers Link New Android Backdoor to North Korean Hackers

The recently discovered KevDroid Android backdoor is tied to the North Korean hacking group APT37, Palo Alto Networks researchers say.
Also tracked as Reaper, Group 123, Red Eyes, and ScarCruft, the threat group was observed earlier this year to be using a Flash Player zero-day vulnerability and  has been expanding the scope and sophistication of its campaigns over the past months.
Recently, the group was said to have targeted victims with Android spyware via spear phishing emails. Cisco’s Talos security researchers analyzed the malware, which they called KevDroid, but weren’t able to find a strong connection with the group.
According to Palo Alto Networks, however, KevDroid is indeed part of APT37’s arsenal of mobile tools. Furthermore, the security researchers were able to find a more advanced version of the spyware, as well as Trojanized iterations of legitimate applications that are used as downloaders for the malware.
The Android spyware was initially found to be masquerading as an anti-virus app from Naver, a large search and web portal service provider in South Korea.
One version of the malware, Palo Alto’s Ruchna Nigam discovered, would call home to cgalim[.]com, a domain already associated with the Reaper group’s non-mobile attacks. Artefacts from the original malware variant eventually revealed a more advanced iteration of the malware, the security researcher notes.
The threat actor apparently uses two Trojanized application versions to distribute Android spyware variants. The legitimate applications – Bitcoin Ticker Widget and PyeongChang Winter Games – are distributed through Google Play, but the malicious variants never made it to the official app store.
The two Trojanized applications, which are signed with the same certificate, contact the same URL to fetch payloads, and were observed serving an advanced iteration of the Android spyware. Each of the malicious apps was created to “respectively download and drop one specific variant of Reaper’s Android spyware,” the Nigam says.
Once installed, the apps would display a message asking the user to update them. If the user accepts the update, however, the malicious payload is downloaded instead and saved as AppName.apk. Next, the payload is loaded and the user is asked to confirm the installation.
The spyware can record audio and video, capture screenshots, grab the phone’s file listing, fetch specific files, download a list of commands, get device info, and root the device. Additionally, it can steal voice recordings from incoming and outgoing calls, call logs, SMS history, contact lists, and information on registered accounts on the phone.
Unlike the previously detailed variants of the malware that used an open source library to record calls, the most recent – and more advanced – variant of the malware writes its own call recording library.
“The emergence of a new attack vector, followed by the appearance of new variants disguising themselves as currently relevant applications like the Winter Olympics, indicates expanding operations of the Reaper group that are actively in development,” Nigam concludes.

2,APT37,"North Korea Cyber Threat 'More Aggressive Than China': US Firm

North Korean hackers are becoming more aggressive than their Chinese counterparts, a leading US cybersecurity firm warned Tuesday, as it identified a Pyongyang-linked group as an ""advanced persistent threat"".
It was the first time that FireEye had used the designation for a North Korean-based group.
Analysts say the isolated and impoverished but nuclear-armed North has stepped up hacking operations partly to raise money for the cash-strapped regime, which is subject to multiple sanctions over its atomic weapons and ballistic missile programs.
North Korea has previously been blamed for the WannaCry ransomware that briefly wreaked havoc around the world last year -- an accusation it angrily denies.
FireEye said North Korean operatives had expanded their targets beyond South Korea and mounted increasingly sophisticated attacks, adding it had identified a suspected North Korean cyberespionage group it dubbed ""APT37"" -- standing for ""advanced persistent threat"".
APT37 was ""primarily based in North Korea"", it said, and its choice of targets ""aligns with North Korean state interests"".
""We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government,"" it added.
APT37 has been active at least since 2012, it said, previously focused on ""government, military, defence industrial base and media sector"" in the rival South before widening its range to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East last year, and industries ranging from chemicals to telecommunications.
""This group should be taken seriously,"" FireEye added.
FireEye's first APT was identified in a 2013 report by company division Mandiant, which said that hackers penetrating US newspapers, government agencies and companies ""are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them"".
One group, it said then, was believed to be a branch of the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai called Unit 61398. Five of its members were later indicted by US federal prosecutors on charges of stealing information from US firms, provoking a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.
""We have seen both North Korean and Chinese operations range from simplistic to very technically sophisticated,"" FireEye's director of intelligence analysis John Hultquist told AFP.
""The sharpest difference between the two really lies in the aggressive nature of North Korean operations,"" he added.
""Whereas Chinese actors have typically favoured quiet espionage, North Korea has demonstrated a willingness to carry out some very aggressive activity, ranging from attack to outright global crime.""
But the WannaCry ransomware, he believes, was the work of a different North Korean group. ""Thus far, we have only found APT37 doing the quiet espionage but they are a tool the regime can use aggressively."" 
The North is known to operate an army of thousands of well-trained hackers that have attacked South Korean firms, institutions and even rights groups helping North Korean refugees.
Its cyberwarfare abilities first came to prominence when it was accused of hacking into Sony Pictures Entertainment to take revenge for ""The Interview,"" a satirical film that mocked its leader Kim Jong Un. 
More recently, according to analysts, the North's hackers have stepped up campaigns to raise funds by attacking cryptocurrency exchanges as the value of bitcoin and other cybercurrencies soared.  ",https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-cyber-threat-more-aggressive-china-us-firm

4,APT37,"North Korea's Flash Player Flaw Now Exploited by Cybercriminals

Endpoint security firm Morphisec has spotted a massive campaign that exploits a recently patched Adobe Flash Player vulnerability to deliver malware.
The flaw in question, CVE-2018-4878, is a use-after-free bug that Adobe patched on February 6, following reports that North Korean hackers had been exploiting the vulnerability in attacks aimed at South Korea. The threat group, tracked as APT37, Reaper, Group123 and ScarCruft, has been expanding the scope and sophistication of its campaigns.
After Adobe patched the security hole, which allows remote code execution, other malicious actors started looking into ways to exploit CVE-2018-4878.
Morphisec said it spotted a campaign on February 22, which had been using a version of the exploit similar to the one developed by APT37. However, researchers pointed out that the exploit in the malspam campaign, unlike the one used in the original attacks, did not have a 64-bit version.
The attack starts with a spam email containing a link to a document stored on safe-storage[.]biz. Once downloaded and opened, the document informs users that an online preview is not available and instructs them to enable editing mode in order to view the content.
If users comply, the Flash vulnerability is exploited and the Windows command prompt is executed. The associated cmd.exe file is then injected with malicious shellcode that connects to the attacker’s domain.
A DLL file is then downloaded by the shellcode and executed using the Microsoft Register Server (regsvr32) utility. The legitimate tool is abused in an effort to bypass whitelisting products.
The malicious documents and the Flash exploit were only detected by a few security solutions based on their signature at the time of Morphisec’s analysis.
Since the URLs included in the spam emails were created using Google’s URL shortening service, researchers determined that each of the different links delivered in this campaign had been clicked tens and even hundreds of times within 3-4 days of being created. Users clicked on the links from various browsers and email services, including Outlook, Gmail and Aruba.it.
“As expected and predicted, adversaries have quickly adopted the Flash exploit, which is easily reproducible,” Morphisec’s Michael Gorelik explained in a blog post. “With small variations to the attack, they successfully launched a massive malspam campaign and bypassed most of the existing static scanning solutions once again.”

5,APT37,"Researchers Say Code Reuse Links North Korea's Malware

Following trails of reused code, security researchers at Intezer and McAfee have uncovered new links between malware families attributed to North Korean threat groups and tracked most of the samples to the infamous Lazarus Group.
Code reuse isn’t novel, and many cases where cybercriminals and threat actors employed this technique have been already reported on. In fact, actors operating from the same country have been often observed sharing malware code and infrastructure, which often makes attribution highly problematic.
For security researchers, the reuse of code between different malware families and variations and between one campaign to another means that they can gain insight into the activities of threat actors, and this is exactly what Intezer and McAfee focused on in their recent analysis.
The multiple cyber campaigns attributed to North Korean hackers have been so far focused on two different directions: to raise money or pursue nationalist aims.
Thus there’s a workforce of hackers that focuses on cybercrime activities such as hacking into financial institutions (Unit 180) and another to gather intelligence from other nations and to try to disrupt rival states and military targets (Unit 121).
The researchers focused on the latter and discovered “many overlaps in code reuse,” which led them to the conclusion that nation-state sponsored groups were active in those efforts.
After analyzing thousands of malware samples, many unclassified or uncategorized, the researchers noticed a “significant amount of code similarities between almost every one of the attacks associated with North Korea.”
One similarity was found in the server message block (SMB) module of WannaCry (2017), Mydoom (2009), Joanap, and DeltaAlfa.
The use of these malware families has been already attributed to the Lazarus Group, which is tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra.
Believed to have orchestrated the $81 million heist from the Bangladesh bank, and seen as the most serious threat to banks, the group is also said to have launched campaigns such as Operation Blockbuster, Dark Seoul, and Operation Troy.
The researchers also noticed a similarity between three different remote access Trojans, namely NavRAT, Gold Dragon, and a DLL from the South Korean gambling hacking campaign, all three believed to be affiliated with Group 123 (also tracked as Reaper, APT37, and ScarCruft).
There’s also a connection between the Brambul malware (2009) and KorDllBot (2011), based on code responsible for launching a cmd.exe with a net share. Both malware families are attributed to Lazarus.
The security researchers also discovered a connection between the Tapaoux (or DarkHotel) malware family and samples from Operation Troy.
The code reuse and sharing between various threat groups known to be affiliated with North Korea has revealed that most malware families link back to Lazarus. The only malware that stands apart are the RATs attributed to Group 123, which are linked to one another.
“The malware attributed to the group Lazarus has code connections that link many of the malware families spotted over the years. Lazarus is a collective name for many DPRK cyber operations, and we clearly see links between malware families used in different campaigns,” the security researchers note.
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned of a new malware variant dubbed KEYMARBLE, which the U.S. government has attributed to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government. DHS says the malware is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) capable of accessing device configuration data, downloading additional files, executing commands, modifying the registry, capturing screenshots, and exfiltrating data. More details on KEYMARBLE are available from the malware report (AR18-221A) from the DHS.
