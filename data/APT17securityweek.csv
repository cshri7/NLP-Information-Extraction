0,APT17,"Chinese Threat Group Uses Microsoft's TechNet Portal to Host C&C IPs

The Chinese threat actor known as APT17 and DeputyDog has been using profile pages and forum threads on Microsoft’s TechNet web portal to host IP addresses for command and control (C&C) servers.
Researchers at FireEye Threat Intelligence and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center have prepared a brief report on the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor’s C&C obfuscation techniques.
Experts have determined that the attackers haven’t actually compromised Microsoft’s website. Instead, they are using the portal’s legitimate functionality to host encoded strings that hide C&C IP addresses.
APT17 is a Chinese threat group that has been targeting United States government organizations, the military, law firms, defense contractors, IT firms, mining companies, and NGOs. One of the tools leveraged by the group is BLACKCOFFEE, a backdoor that can be used to upload and download files, create a reverse shell on the infected system, enumerate files and processes, manipulate files, and terminate processes.
The malware, which has been used by APT17 since at least 2013, now gets the IP address of the C&C server it’s supposed to communicate with from an encoded string embedded on the TechNet portal.
The new version of BLACKCOFFEE contains URLs that point to TechNet forum threads or biography sections in profiles created by the attacker. The encoded string that hides the IP address in plain sight is found in profiles and posts between the “@MICROSOFT” and “CORPORATION” tags.
In one example mentioned in the report from FireEye and Microsoft, the encoded IP address was published by the attackers in a forum post that appeared to contain useful information for solving a user’s problem.
Once the IP for the C&C is obtained, the malware starts communicating with the server. BLACKCOFFEE uses the C&C server to receive commands and to send information stolen from the infected device back to the malicious actors.
“If the C2 server is discovered or shut down, the threat actors can update the encoded IP address on TechNet to maintain control of the victims’ machines,” the companies explained in the report.
Experts have pointed out that the use of a legitimate service, dubbed by some a “dead drop resolver,” and the embedding of an encoded IP address benefits the attackers because it delays detection, and can prevent the discovery of the C&C server’s IP address. FireEye believes other threat groups are already using, or will use, variations of this technique in their operations.
“After discovering the BLACKCOFFEE activity, the FireEye-Microsoft team encoded a sinkhole IP address into the profile pages and forum threads and locked the accounts to prevent the threat actors from making any changes,” the report noted. “This collaborative approach allowed the team to observe the malware and its victims. With this information, Microsoft and FireEye can work with the anti-virus community to generate signatures to identify and clean systems affected by the malware and alert other forum and message board managers to be on the lookout for this technique.”",https://www.securityweek.com/chinese-threat-group-uses-microsofts-technet-portal-host-cc-ips
1,APT17,"Researchers Link CCleaner Attack to State-sponsored Chinese Hackers

The sophisticated supply chain attack that resulted in millions of users downloading a backdoored version of the popular CCleaner PC software utility was the work of state-sponsored Chinese hackers, according to a new report.
The attack started with the compromise of a CCleaner server in early July, which allowed hackers to inject backdoor code in two versions of the tool, namely 32-bit CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191. Between August 15 and September 12, over 2.27 million users downloaded the infected binaries.
Investigation into the attack revealed that the backdoored code was only the first stage of the intended user compromise, and that a second-stage payload had been delivered to a small number of selected targets.
After finding the backup of a deleted database containing information on the infected machines, investigators discovered that a total of 1,646,536 unique machines (based on MAC addresses) reported to the command and control (C&C) server. The stage 2 payload, however, was served to only 40 of them.
Soon after the investigation started, the security researchers looking into the incident discovered some connections to a known group of Chinese hackers, but no definite attribution was made.
Now, Intezer researchers suggest that the attack was state-sponsored and that it can indeed be attributed to Chinese hackers that are part of the Axiom group.
Also referred to as APT17 or DeputyDog, the group was previously associated with Operation Aurora, which started in 2009 and targeted companies such as Google, Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, and Dow Chemical. The group specializes in supply chain attacks and Operation Aurora is considered one of the most sophisticated incidents ever.
According to Intezer, an analysis of the stage 2 payload used in the CCleaner attack provided a clear link to the Chinese hackers after the first payload (the backdoor in the installer) revealed shared code with Axiom group.
While looking at the backdoor, the researchers discovered unique code implementation “only previously seen in APT17 and not in any public repository.” Now, they reveal that the stage 2 payload contains code that is an exact match to APT17 malware seen before.
“The author probably copied and pasted the code, which is what often happens to avoid duplicative efforts: rewriting the same code for the same functionality twice. Due to the uniqueness of the shared code, we strongly concluded that the code was written by the same attacker,” Intezer’s Jay Rosenberg notes.
Analysis of the stage 2 payload revealed that one of the dropped modules is another backdoor designed to connect to a few domains. It would also connect to an IP to grab the next stage payload, which the researchers haven’t been able to identify until now.
“The complexity and quality of this particular attack has led our team to conclude that it was most likely state-sponsored. Considering this new evidence, the malware can be attributed to the Axiom group due to both the nature of the attack itself and the specific code reuse throughout that our technology was able to uncover,” Rosenberg concludes.

2,APT17,"CCleaner Incident Investigation Reveals Possible Stage 3 Payload

CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - The investigation into the September 2017 CCleaner incident has revealed what appears to be a stage three payload that attackers supposedly intended to deliver to infected users.
The attack was disclosed on September 18, when security firm Avast revealed that 2.27 million users worldwide had downloaded an infected CCleaner installation file between August 15 and September 12. Hackers had added a backdoor to the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 releases, Avast revealed.
What led to this was the compromise of the distribution servers of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, in the months before Avast purchased the software firm. The code in the modified installers could collect non-sensitive information from the infected machines, and could also deliver a second stage binary.
This revealed that the incident was in fact a highly targeted attack, as the second-stage payload was delivered to only 40 computers out of the millions that downloaded stage one. While no stage three binary was found on the affected systems, Avast now says that the attackers, the Chinese hacking group Axiom (also known as APT17 or DeputyDog), apparently had plans to deliver such malware as well.
During its investigation of the Piriform infrastructure, the security firm discovered not only stage one and stage two binaries on the network, but also evidence of a third stage on four computers. Dubbed ShadowPad, this is a specialized tool that provides cybercriminals with remote control capabilities.
In an August 2017 report, Kaspersky revealed that the ShadowPad backdoor was found in NetSarang’s products, which are used by hundreds of companies in the financial, software, media, energy, electronics, insurance, industrial, construction, manufacturing, retail, telecoms, pharmaceutical, and transportation sectors.
“The tool was installed on the four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of the second stage had been installed on the computers March 12th, 2017,” Avast says.
The command and control (C&C) server the older second stage variant was attempting to connect to was no longer up during the investigation and the researchers don’t know exactly what it was supposed to download. However, given the timeline of events, they assume that it “had downloaded and installed ShadowPad on the four Piriform computers.”
The fact that ShadowPad is believed to have been developed by the Axiom group, the same actor behind the CCleaner attack, is also a strong indicator that this malware was intended to become the third stage payload, Avast says.
The ShadowPad version used in the attack was custom-built, leading investigators to suspect it was explicitly created for Piriform.
The security firm also discovered ShadowPad log files containing encrypted key strokes from a keylogger that became active on the infected machines on April 12, 2017. Other tools were also installed on the four computers, including a password stealer, along with tools that could install more software and plugins on the infected machines.
“While ShadowPad was installed on the Piriform network itself and, as far as we can tell through our investigations today, not on any of the CCleaner customers’ computers, we believe that this tool was the intended third stage for the CCleaner customers,” Avast says.
The second-stage malware deployed to only 40 computers of the millions that downloaded the infected CCleaner versions, but Avast couldn’t determine whether the third stage payload was meant for all of them or only a few, if any.

3,APT17,"Researchers Link Several State-Sponsored Chinese Spy Groups

Researchers have discovered links between several cyber espionage groups believed to be sponsored by the Chinese government and found that at least some of them may be working from the Xicheng District of Beijing.
A report published last week by 401TRG, the threat research and analysis team at ProtectWise, revealed links between several campaigns conducted over the past decade. Researchers claim that various threat groups previously attributed to Chinese-speaking actors are all connected to China’s state intelligence apparatus under what they call the “Winnti umbrella.”
Threat actors such as Winnti, Gref, PlayfullDragon, APT17, DeputyDog, Axiom, BARIUM, LEAD, PassCV, Wicked Panda, and ShadowPad are all believed to be part of the Winnti umbrella based on the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and overlaps in infrastructure and operations. Experts believe they are “the work of individual teams, including contractors external to the Chinese government, with varying levels of expertise, cooperating on a specific agenda.”
These hacker groups have been active since at least 2009 – possibly as early as 2007 – and their initial targets are often gaming studios and high-tech companies located in countries such as the United States, Japan, South Korea and China. The main goal appears to be harvesting code-signing certificates and manipulating software, with a secondary objective of financial gain.
Researchers said the Winnti umbrella’s main targets appear to be political, such as Uyghur and Tibetan activists, Tibetan and Chinese journalists, the government of Thailand (e.g. Bookworm), and major international tech companies.
These groups continue to launch campaigns, with operations seen as recently as late March. In the attacks observed this year, the hackers have focused on phishing – particularly targeted at Office 365 and Gmail accounts – rather than malware and exploits.
The cyberspies often target cloud storage accounts from which they hope to obtain code-signing certificates. In some cases, they also seek files and documents that could help them escalate privileges and move laterally within the victim’s network.
While the attackers have taken steps to hide their identity, they have made some mistakes, providing investigators important clues about their possible location.
“In the attackers’ ideal situation, all remote access occurs through their own C2 infrastructure, which acts as a proxy and obscures their true location,” 401TRG said in its report. “However, we have observed a few cases of the attackers mistakenly accessing victim machines without a proxy, potentially identifying the true location of the individual running the session. In all of these cases, the net block was 221.216.0.0/13, the China Unicom Beijing Network, Xicheng District.”

4,APT17,"Cyber Espionage Targets Interests in South China Sea

A cyber espionage campaign has been discovered apparently targeting participants in the recent Permanent Court of Arbitration case brought by the Philippines against China over Chinese claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The case was found against China last month. China itself did not accept the validity of the case, did not attend the arbitration, and has since rejected the ruling.
The cyber espionage campaign was discovered by F-Secure. It named it NanHaiShu, and has today published an analysis  of the methodology and malware involved. NanHaiShu (南海鼠) translates to ""South China Sea Rat"" in English.
The malware was delivered by highly targeted emails in which individually crafted messages demonstrate that only specific organizations were targeted. These include the Philippines Court of Justice, the organizers of last November's APEC Summit held in the Philippines (during which it was expected that the South China Sea dispute would be discussed), and a major international law firm that represents one of the parties in the dispute.
The malware delivered to the law firm was contained in an Excel macro. The message talks about ""the range of salaries and/or bonuses"", and the XLS attachment filename is 'Salary and Bonus Data.xls'. The combination of the email message and a VBA delivery mechanism suggests that considerable effort was put into researching the targets and socially engineering the attack. VBA simply will not work for targets with Excel's default settings, suggesting that the attackers were aware that their targets specifically allow macros within their day to day work.
The malware itself is a remote access trojan (RAT) capable of downloading additional malware and exfiltrating files to the C&C server. F-Secure doesn't know what files might have stolen from the victims, so cannot absolutely confirm the arbitration case as the primary motive. The timeline of infections, targets and notable events around the arbitration does, however, provide compelling circumstantial evidence.
The malware shows strong indications of Chinese origins, with code reused from Chinese forums. ""The malware's VBA base64 decoder function seems to be popular among Chinese programmers,"" notes the report. ""Searching for the variable names on the Internet leads to a handful of Chinese websites.""
But F-Secure does not attribute the attacks to the Chinese government, nor even to a specific Chinese malware group. F-Secure cyber security advisor Erka Koivunen told SecurityWeek that he cannot say for certain that the malware relates to any existing group (although some researchers are looking for similarities with the APT 17 group and the BLACKCOFFEE). He also said that attributing the attacks to the Chinese government would be a step too far; but he did say that he expects to see more of this group in the future.
Despite F-Secure's refusal to describe this campaign as state-sponsored, there will undoubtedly be those who will make such an assumption. Since China was not present at an international arbitration case involving their own territorial claims means they would not have direct access to some of the information presented or discussed. Espionage would be one way to obtain this information.
Under such an assumption, the NanHaiShu gang become the equivalent of LEA informants -- neither under the control of nor working to the instructions of the LEA, but nevertheless providing welcome information to that LEA.
One thing is certain -- Chinese feelings in the South China Sea run deep. Soon after after the ruling it commenced a major wargames exercise with, according to ZeroHedge, ""some 300 ships, dozens of fighter planes, and involved troops that are responsible for coastal defense radars, communications, and electronic warfare defense.""
