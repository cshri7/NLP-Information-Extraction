0,"APT17: Hiding in Plain
Sight - FireEye and Microsoft Expose Obfuscation Tactic     Threat actors have found a new way to
dodge security professionals, using popular websites’ legitimate
functionalities to hide their hacking operations. FireEye Threat
Intelligence and Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center discovered a
China-based threat group dubbed APT17 using Microsoft’s TechNet blog
for its Command-and-Control (CnC) operation.  Interestingly, APT17 chose not to
compromise TechNet, but rather created profiles and posted in forums
to post its encoded CnC. Doing so made it more difficult for network
security professionals to determine the CnC’s true location, which
allowed APT17 to conduct its activities for longer than it might have otherwise.  This report details how we discovered the
operation, what was done to shut it down, and how other threat groups
have already adopted a “hide in plain sight” approach to hacking.  Download the report to find out:   Who APT17 is and who they’re
targeting  How they bypassed traditional methods to avoid
detection  How this new method of compromise differs from
previous tactics  What FireEye and Microsoft did to shut
down APT17’s use of the Microsoft TechNet blog   Download the report today.",https://www.fireeye.com//current-threats/apt-groups/rpt-apt17.html,APT17
