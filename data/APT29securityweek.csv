0,APT29,"APT29 Uses Stealthy Backdoor to Maintain Access to Targets

Researchers at FireEye-owned Mandiant have conducted a detailed analysis of a stealthy backdoor used by the Russia-linked cyberespionage group APT29 to maintain access to targeted systems.
Dubbed “POSHSPY,” the malware is believed to be a secondary backdoor used by the cyberspies in case they lose access to their primary backdoors. Mandiant first spotted POSHSPY in 2015 during an incident response engagement, and identified it on the networks of several organizations over the past two years.
Similar to other pieces of malware used by APT29, POSHSPY leverages PowerShell and the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) administrative framework.
WMI can be used to obtain system information, start and stop processes, and configure conditional triggers. In the case of POSHSPY, WMI is used to run a PowerShell command that decrypts and executes the backdoor code directly from a WMI property, thus ensuring that no artifacts are left on the hard drive.
The WMI component of POSHSPY executes the PowerShell component on every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 11:33 AM local time.
Experts pointed out that the use of legitimate Windows tools and the other techniques employed in these attacks increase the backdoor’s chances of evading detection.
“POSHSPY's use of WMI to both store and persist the backdoor code makes it nearly invisible to anyone not familiar with the intricacies of WMI. Its use of a PowerShell payload means that only legitimate system processes are utilized and that the malicious code execution can only be identified through enhanced logging or in memory,” explained Matthew Dunwoody, incident response consultant at Mandiant.
“The backdoor's infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult. Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert,” Dunwoody added.
The malware allows attackers to download and execute additional PowerShell code and executable files. The threat communicates with command and control (C&C) servers located at URLs generated using a domain generation algorithm (DGA) that relies on lists of domain names, TLDs, subdomains, URIs, file names and file extensions. C&C communications are encrypted using AES and RSA public key cryptography.
FireEye has not shared any information on which countries or what types of organizations have been targeted in attacks involving the POSHSPY backdoor.
The APT29 group has put some effort into making its operations more difficult to detect. Earlier this month, FireEye detailed the threat actor’s use of a technique called “domain fronting” to disguise the malicious traffic generated by its tools.
APT29 is also known as The Dukes, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke. The group is believed to be behind the recent election-related attacks in the U.S. and a campaign targeting high-profile organizations in Norway.

1,APT29,"APT29 Cyberspies Use Domain Fronting to Evade Detection

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group known as APT29 has been using a technique called “domain fronting” in an effort to make it more difficult for targeted organizations to identify malicious traffic, FireEye reported on Monday.
Domain fronting is a censorship bypassing technique that involves disguising traffic to make it look as if it’s going to a host allowed by the censor, such as Google, Amazon or CloudFlare. Open Whisper Systems recently implemented the technique to help Signal users in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates bypass government censorship.
According to FireEye, the technique has been used for at least two years by the threat actor APT29, which is also known as The Dukes, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke. The group is believed to be behind the recent election-related attacks in the U.S. and a campaign targeting high-profile organizations in Norway.
APT29 has used the Tor anonymity network to communicate with infected machines, which could be considered suspicious by some defenders. In order to disguise Tor traffic as apparently legitimate traffic, the cyberspies used Meek, a Tor plugin that implements domain fronting and allows users to send traffic to Tor inside a harmless-looking HTTPS POST request to google.com.
In its attacks, APT29 used a PowerShell script and a .bat file to install the Tor client and the Meek plugin on the targeted system. They leveraged an exploit involving the Sticky Keys accessibility feature, where they replaced the legitimate executable with the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) file. This provides the attacker a shell that they can use to execute commands with SYSTEM-level privileges, including to add or modify accounts.
The script that executes the Sticky Keys exploit also creates a Windows service named “Google Update” to ensure that the backdoor remains even after the system has been rebooted.
“APT29 adopted domain fronting long before these techniques were widely known,” said FireEye’s Matthew Dunwoody. “By employing a publicly available implementation, they were able to hide their network traffic, with minimal research or development, and with tools that are difficult to attribute. Detecting this activity on the network requires visibility into TLS connections and effective network signatures.”

2,APT29,"Russian Hacker Tool Uses Legitimate Web Services to Hide Attacks: FireEye

HAMMERTOSS Malware From Russian Hackers Uses Popular Web Services to Conceal Attacks
A group of sophisticated hackers from Russia are using a malware tool that helps them hide Malicious activity within legitimate network traffic by leveraging common web services such as Twitter, GitHub and cloud storage providers, FireEye said Wednesday.
The malicious backdoor, which FireEye has dubbed “HAMMERTOSS”, was first discovered by the security firm in early 2015 and is being used by a Russian APT group to relay commands and extract data from compromised targets.
The threat actor group behind HAMMERTOSS is tracked by FireEye as APT29, a group that the company describes as “one of the most capable” threat groups they track.
FireEye researchers explained that the malware communication process used by HAMMERTOSS could be broken down into several stages to explain how the tool operates, receives instructions, and extracts information from a victim’s network.
“HAMMERTOSS combines all of the best practices of malware development,” Jordan Berry, a Threat Intelligence Analyst at FireEye, told SecurityWeek.

The first stage leverages Twitter, and utilizes specific accounts that are created by a predictable algorithm and changed daily.
“In the second stage, the malware looks for a tweet containing a URL and a hashtag,” Berry said. “The URL will direct the malware implant to download an image.”
Stage-three downloads the image as directed by the tweet, which contains appended and encrypted data at the end of the file and has instructions for the malware.
“While the image appears normal, it actually contains steganographic data. Steganography is the practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file,” FireEye’s report explained.
Finally, the malware uses PowerShell to execute command on the compromised host and send that information to a cloud storage provider.  
“These techniques have been used by other threat groups in the past in the singular, but the whole operation in total is what is what’s really unique about HAMMERTOSS,” Jen Weedon, Threat Intelligence Manager at FireEye, told SecurityWeek. The APT29 attackers are suspected by FireEye to be a Russian APT group, and also believed to be connected to MiniDuke and OnionDuke attack campaigns.  
HAMMERTOSS isn’t being deployed by the attackers in a wide manner, Weedon said, adding that the malware is likely being used as a backup tool in the event its primary tools were discovered.
“HAMMERTOSS seems to be only deployed against critical targets, so we think [the attackers] are only using it when other tools aren’t working, or if their operation has been disrupted in some way,” she said.
“We speculate that APT29 may make modifications to HAMMERTOSS or abandon it altogether and develop a new tool if they discover incident responders or antivirus software is detecting it,” FireEye’s report concluded. ""The group has demonstrated an understanding of network defenders’ countermeasures. During our investigations, APT29 continually deployed new versions of backdoors to fix bugs and add functions, as well as kept tabs on network defenders’ activities to counter attempts to clean the client’s system to maintain access to the victim environment.""
FireEye told SecurityWeek that it has been in touch with both Twitter and the cloud storage provider(s) used in relation to the few attacks campaigns they have witnessed. FireEye researchers would not disclose the cloud storage provider by name, only saying that it was a top three provider of cloud storage services.
As of the time of publishing, an MD5 for HAMMERTOSS provided by FireEye was detected by just 4 of 56 anti-malware engines on VirusTotal.
The full report (PDF) from FireEye is available online, and FireEye produced a short video (below) which explained the overall threat.

3,APT29,"Norway Accuses Russia of Cyberattack

Oslo - Norway's foreign ministry, army and other institutions were targeted in a recent cyberattack by a group suspected of ties to Russian authorities, Norwegian intelligence -- which was among the targets -- said Friday.
Known as APT 29, the group singled out by Oslo has already been accused of hacking interference in the US election last year.
""Nine different email accounts were targeted in an attempt at what is called spear phishing, in other words malicious emails,"" Arne Christian Haugstoyl, an official with Norway's intelligence service PST, told television channel TV2.
""It's difficult to know what the goal"" of the operation was, he said, adding that Norway was alerted to the attack by an allied country.
He described APT 29 as a group ""with links to the Russian authorities"".
PST spokesman Martin Bernsen, quoted by daily Verdens Gang (VG), said there was ""no reason to believe that classified information had been obtained in connection with the attack.""
In addition to the foreign ministry, the army and PST itself, the attack -- the date of which was not disclosed -- also targeted the Norwegian radiation protection agency, a school and the parliamentary group of the Labour party, the traditionally dominant political party in Norway but which is currently in opposition.
Legislative elections are scheduled for September 11, though no link has been made to the vote.
Norway, a NATO member, and its neighbor Russia normally enjoy good relations but ties have grown more tense in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.
The Scandinavian country on Wednesday summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest after Moscow refused visas to two senior lawmakers in a move Oslo denounced as ""unjustifiable"".
Russia said the visa refusal was a reaction to Norway's participation in EU economic sanctions against it over the Ukraine crisis.
Moscow was also angered by the recent deployment of some 300 US soldiers on Norwegian soil.",https://www.securityweek.com/norway-accuses-russia-cyberattack
4,APT29,"Google Warns Users of Recent State-sponsored Attacks

Google Warns Journalists and Activists About Recent State-Sponsored Attacks
Over the last few days, Google has delivered a batch of warnings about potential government-backed attacks against numerous journalists, academics and activists. Many of the recipients have announced their personal warnings on Twitter. There are some differences in the wording of some of the warnings, but Google has confirmed that the Twitter postings appear to be authentic.
Google has been issuing such warnings since 2012. At first they were simple text alerts across the top of the recipients' Gmail page. In March of this year it started to use the larger more noticeable banners that are now appearing. The warnings do not indicate that an account has actually been compromised; only that Google researchers have seen indications of an attempt against the account.
The warnings are also not timely. The attack indicators were likely noticed up to a month earlier. Google does not issue immediate warnings for fear that this will allow attackers to determine the method of discovery. This time lapse has led to certain assumptions that the attackers are likely to be the Russian actors, possibly APT28 or APT29, that were linked to attacks against the Democrats, supposedly to influence the election. (Last month, Russian hackers were also linked with targeting journalists investigating the MH17 crash.)

This, however, has to be conjecture. Google does not publicly provide any evidence on the identity of the attackers -- and at least one target is a Hong-Kong-based Chinese activist (Joshua Wong Chi-fung).
""Google has been secretive about the algorithms and criteria it uses to determine that a potential attack is state-sponsored,"" explains ESET senior research fellow David Harley; adding that such secrecy about proprietary algorithms is not unusual in the security industry. ""The relationship with the APT29 targeted malware is speculative, but I can't say there isn't a connection. If an attack is based on code that is associated with known state-sponsored attacks, that could be another indicator, if you have that sort of information. Google isn't exactly known for a spirit of friendly cooperation with the security industry at large, but it certainly has security resources.""
There is, however, an element of hysteria about this current batch of warnings; as if users need to take different precautions against nation attacks than they do against everyday criminal attacks. Activists are more likely to be attacked for political reasons, and in some cases the consequences could be more dire -- but the defenses remain the same as those everybody should be using as a matter of course.
""Journalists and professors already know what they should do - and if they don't, they can easily look it up. If they don't already follow best practices it's because they suffer from the fallacy that they aren't important enough to target,"" comments F-Secure's Sean Sullivan. It is certainly true that users receiving Google warnings should take immediate steps to confirm the integrity of their account: Google doesn't say the attack was successful, but nor does it say it failed.
Caleb Chen, who works with Private Internet Access, points out that state-sponsored attacks may be more prevalent than is commonly thought. Google says only that it is likely to happen to less than 0.1% of its users. If there are a billion Gmail users, he suggests, those figures mean that up to a million may have seen state-sponsored probing. ""As cyber-attacks continue to proliferate, often times across borders, expect reports of this type of probing to rise in the future."" 
There is also an irony about warnings being attributed to foreign governments coming at the same time as the US and particularly the UK governments are increasing their own surveillance capabilities. Luis Corrons, technical director at PandaLabs insists there is a difference. ""One thing is knowing that governments are harvesting loads of information from everyone, and another thing is an attack targeted at you, so they can compromise your computer and access (steal) all your information, sources, etc.""
Nevertheless, Chen reports a 30% spike in VPN sales from the UK in the week in which the IP Bill completed its course through parliament. While standard computer defenses are required to protect accounts, VPNs are now also required to protect communications -- especially those of activists of any persuasion.
Account defenses obviously include strong passwords, 2FA where possible, reputable anti-virus, and an awareness of spear-phishing techniques; but Corrons offers one other piece of advice for journalists and activists: ""Ideally have all your sensitive information in a different computer to the one you use for your emails, Internet, etc. Even better if this one is not connected to the Internet.""",https://www.securityweek.com/google-warns-users-recent-state-sponsored-attacks
5,APT29,"Democracy at Risk from Poor Cybersecurity, Foreign Interference: Survey

Survey Shows Distinct Voter Concern for Elections and Cybersecurity
For more than a year, a single thread has dominated American news: foreign interference in US elections. It started in June 2016 in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced it had been hacked, and CrowdStrike accused Russia-based Cozy Bear (APT 29).
Since then, the ramifications have rarely been out of the news. In October 2016 the U.S. government formally accused Russia of being behind the cyberattacks, and by December it became known that the CIA believed that ""Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system,"" The Washington Post reported.
Since then, emphasis has switched to questioning the extent to which the Trump electoral team may or may not have known about or colluded with Russia in order to win the election; and whether it has or has not attempted to hinder or subvert subsequent law enforcement investigations. This has continued throughout 2017 until Wednesday this week when Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) formally introduced an article of impeachment against President Trump.
The article of impeachment revolves around Trump's dismissal of FBI director James Comey allegedly to hinder the FBI's investigation into former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn. ""In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.""
The huge and apparently unending ramifications of what started as just another cyber hack has caused cybersecurity firm Carbon Black to wonder what effect the cyber element has had on the American electorate. In June 2017, it conducted a nationwide survey (PDF) of 5,000 eligible U.S. voters, with particular reference to the upcoming midterm 2018 elections.
In an associated blog post Carbon Black CEO Patrick Morley commented, ""In perhaps the most startling revelation from the survey, 1 in 4 voters said they will consider not voting in upcoming elections over cybersecurity fears.""
In reality, this figure is easily covered by existing non-voters. Approximately only 57.9% of voters voted in the 2016 election, down less than 1% from the 58.6% that voted in 2012. So, while 25% of voters now say they may not vote in the midterms, this may have no effect on the actual voter turnout.
A second area where the obvious conclusion may not be the accurate conclusion can be seen in 'voter perception on election influence'. According to the survey, ""47% of voters said they believe the 2016 U.S. election was influenced by foreign entities."" However, there could be a strong element of 'sore loser' in these figures. There is an aspect of tribalism in political affiliation -- some people will always vote for one particular party simply because of tribal affiliations. 
It is estimated that 48% of the electorate voted for Clinton (slightly more than the estimated 46% who voted Trump). There will be a strong incentive for the losing 48% to blame external causes on their loss -- and that could account for a large proportion of the 47% of responding voters who told Carbon Black that the result was influenced by foreign entities.
Despite not being able to definitively relate current sentiment to a past or future threat against electoral democracy, the Carbon Black survey nevertheless shows distinct voter concern for elections and cybersecurity. Several of the survey queries are unambiguous, and the results can be taken at face value. Forty-five percent of voters believe that Russia poses the biggest cybersecurity risk to U.S. elections. Of the remaining 55%, ""20% said the United States itself; 17% said North Korea; 11% said China; and 4% said Iran. (3% answered 'other.')"" notes the report.
Fifty-four percent of respondents ""said the NSA leaks negatively impacted their trust in the U.S. election system to keep data safe;"" and 44% ""said they believe Russia will 'Be back' to influence future elections.""
Carbon Black concludes, ""Cyberattacks against our elections seed doubt in democracy. The idea that even a single voter is willing to forfeit their vote in fear of a cyberattack is startling. The fact that 1 in 4 voters said they would be willing to do so speaks volumes about how deeply this doubt has penetrated. The alleged cyberattacks surrounding the 2016 elections were a clarion call that foreign entities are motivated to disrupt U.S. elections."" More starkly, it adds, ""Our democracy is at risk.""
Reality is probably not as extreme as this suggests. Political sentiment polling is very difficult, and Carbon Black has failed to eliminate 'other causes' in some of its questions. It might, for example, have been better to question 5,000 eligible voters that had actually voted in 2016 to get a more accurate picture of future voting intentions.
Nevertheless, it is clear that there is strong voter concern over the future of elections and cybersecurity. The report makes five proposals designed ""to help restore voter confidence."" The first is to implement stronger cybersecurity protection for online registration systems and voter databases. The second is to limit (or discontinue) the use of electronic voting machines. The third is to create an auditable paper trail of votes in every state and precinct. The fourth is to prohibit online voting.
The fifth is arguably the most important. In January 2017, then U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said, ""I have determined that election infrastructure in this country should be designated as a subsector of the existing Government Facilities critical infrastructure sector. Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law.""
In its fifth recommendation, Carbon Black now calls for the government to ""commit the same urgency and resources to protecting its elections as it does for 'traditional' critical infrastructure.""",https://www.securityweek.com/democracy-risk-poor-cybersecurity-foreign-interference-survey
6,APT29,"Cyberspies Launch U.S. Attacks Hours After Trump Elected

Just hours after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, researchers spotted a series of election-themed spear-phishing attacks aimed at think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the U.S.
According to security firm Volexity, the attacks were launched by a Russia-linked threat group known as The Dukes, APT29, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke. This and another actor believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, known as Pawn Storm and Fancy Bear, are suspected of launching attacks against the U.S. Democratic Party before the presidential election.
Volexity said the Dukes sent out spear-phishing emails from Gmail accounts and compromised email accounts at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). The targeted users specialize in national security, international affairs, defense, public policy, and European and Asian studies.
The Dukes has been targeting think tanks and NGOs in the United States since July 2015. However, in August 2016, the attackers started using a new piece of malware, which Volexity has dubbed “PowerDuke.”
Unlike in previous attacks, which involved ZIP files containing malicious executables, the threat group delivered PowerDuke via emails carrying macro-enabled Word and Excel documents. The malicious documents were set up to install a downloader designed to fetch the PowerDuke backdoor.
PowerDuke was also used in attacks launched in October and the ones observed on November 9, after the presidential election in the U.S.
The first attack wave spotted after the elections involved fake eFax emails titled “The Shocking Truth About Election Rigging in the United States.” This wave was similar to earlier attacks where the APT actor used links pointing to ZIP files to deliver its backdoors.
The second attack used the same eFax theme, but the emails were titled “Elections Outcome Could Be Revised [Facts of Elections Fraud]” and they delivered PowerDuke via macro-enabled documents.
The third wave involved emails coming from a fas.harvard.edu address and messages apparently sent via the “Harvard PDF Mobile Service.” Titled “Why American Elections Are Flawed,” these emails also carried PowerDuke malware.
The next two waves also leveraged Harvard FAS email addresses and they appeared to be forwarded from someone at the Clinton Foundation. The hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0, which experts believe could be a persona used by Russian cyberspies, claimed in October that he had hacked the Clinton Foundation, but the organization refuted the claims.
PowerDuke, which is deployed on a system only after anti-analysis checks are conducted, is capable of collecting information about the infected device, creating and terminating processes, downloading and uploading files, and obtaining text from the current window. The backdoor is hidden in innocent-looking PNG image files and some of its components are loaded only in memory.
The U.S. has officially accused Russia of launching cyberattacks in an effort to interfere with the presidential election. Washington has vowed to respond and some officials even claim the U.S. has already hacked Russia’s critical infrastructure. Moscow has demanded an explanation for these reports.

7,APT29,"Early Toolsets Used by ""Dukes"" Attackers Suggest Russian Roots

A new report published last week by F-Secure details the activities of the threat group behind the notorious Duke malware family, and points to the numerous clues suggesting that the actor is sponsored by the Russian government.
Espionage operations involving threats such as CosmicDuke, MiniDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke (CozyBear/CozyCar), SeaDuke and CloudDuke have been analyzed by several security firms over the past years.
Researchers believe the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor behind these threats, dubbed “the Dukes” and APT29, has been active since at least 2008. The group has mainly focused on Western government institutions, political think tanks, government contractors, and other organizations that possess information related to foreign and security policy decisions.
Kaspersky Lab was the first security firm to report finding a malware of the Duke family when they revealed the existence of MiniDuke back in 2013. However, according to F-Secure, the first malware toolset used by the Dukes appears to be PinchDuke, which had been leveraged in various campaigns between November 2008 and the spring of 2010.
PinchDuke, which consisted of loaders and a Trojan designed for data theft, was first used to target organizations in Georgia, Turkey, Uganda, and the United States. One of the clues suggesting that the threat was developed by Russian speakers is an error message written in Russian found in many of the PinchDuke samples.
Another early version of Duke malware was GeminiDuke, for which experts discovered a sample compiled in January 2009. The GeminiDuke toolset was mainly designed for collecting information on the infected computer’s configuration.
The timezone of the timestamps in the GeminiDuke samples analyzed by F-Secure was UTC+3 for samples compiled during winter and UTC+4 for samples compiled during summer. These time zones correspond to Moscow Standard Time (MST) before Russia decided to stop following Daylight Savings Time in 2011. The samples compiled after 2011 still follow the same pattern, but experts believe the malware developers simply failed to update the computer they were using to compile GeminiDuke.
The most recent versions of Duke malware toolsets are SeaDuke, first used in October 2014, HammerDuke (HAMMERTOSS), first spotted in January 2015, and CloudDuke (MiniDionis/CloudLock), observed since June 2015.
Ever since the first Duke malware samples were discovered, security firms attributed the threats to Russian-speaking actors. In January 2015, F-Secure stated that a Russian government agency was likely behind the attacks. FireEye reached the same conclusion in July when it published a detailed report on the HAMMERTOSS backdoor.
F-Secure believes that the Duke attacks are Russian state-sponsored operations based on the attackers’ apparent motivations and objectives. First of all, experts say all targets possessed foreign and security policy information that could be highly valuable to Russia.
Furthermore, at one point, CosmicDuke had been used to target individuals involved in trafficking illegal substances. Since such victims were spotted only in Russia, researchers believe the country’s law enforcement agencies might have used CosmicDuke as legal spyware.
The times of day in which the malware was compiled and the presence of Russian artefacts in discovered samples simply point to actors located in Russia. However, the considerable financial support and the fact that they are very well organized suggests that the threat group is backed by a government, F-Secure said.
“Based on the length of the Dukes’ activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in the operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group to have significant and most critically, stable financial backing. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-profile targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes,” F-Secure explained in its report on the Dukes. “We therefore believe the Dukes to be a single, large, well-coordinated organization with clear separation of responsibilities and targets.”
Despite the fact that their operations and tools have been exposed and analyzed by the IT security community, the Dukes don’t seem to be discouraged.
“This apparent disregard for publicity suggests, in our opinion, that the benefactors of the Dukes is so powerful and so tightly connected to the group that the Dukes are able to operate with no apparent fear of repercussions on getting caught,” F-Secure said. “We believe the only benefactor with the power to offer such comprehensive protection would be the government of the nation from which the group operates. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either within or directly for a government, thus ruling out the possibility of a criminal gang or another third party.”",https://www.securityweek.com/early-toolsets-used-dukes-attackers-suggest-russian-roots
8,APT29,"U.S. Officially Accuses Russia of Election Hacks

The U.S. government has officially accused Russia of being behind cyberattacks against American political organizations with the intent of interfering with the upcoming Presidential election in November.
“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,” a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said.
“The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there,” the statement reads.
""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the statement adds.
“Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government,” U.S. officials said.
The USIC and DHS say it would be “extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results” by cyberattack or breach. 
Following the accusations, U.S. officals warned that it would act when it wants to protect national interests.
""We will take action to protect our interests, including in cyberspace, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing,"" a senior administration official told AFP.
In response, Moscow called the allegations ""rubbish.""
The decentralized nature of the U.S election system and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place will help make a successful attack challenging, the U.S. says.
Early last month, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that Russia hacks U.S. computer networks ""all the time”.
""The Russians hack our systems all the time, not just government but also corporate"" and personal systems, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, though he did not directly say whether Moscow was behind the DNC hack at the time.
In August, researchers from two security firms uncovered evidence that they say linked a Russian threat actor to the cyberattack targeting the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).
The DCCC was the second Democratic Party committee targeted by hackers over the summer. The first was the Democratic National Committee (DNC) which, according to several security companies, was targeted by two different Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actors: Cozy Bear, also known as Cozy Duke and APT29; and Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit.
In July, SecureWorks reported that Fancy Bear had targeted thousands of Google accounts, including ones belonging to people working for or associated with the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

9,APT29,"North Korea's DDoS Attacks Analyzed Based on IPs

Arbor Networks has used the IP addresses shared recently by United States authorities to analyze distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks attributed to the North Korean government. The security firm believes the data may not be as useful for organizations as the U.S. hopes.
Earlier this month, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) released a technical alert on behalf of the DHS and the FBI to warn organizations of North Korea’s Hidden Cobra activities, particularly its DDoS botnet infrastructure.
Hidden Cobra, a threat actor tracked by others as Lazarus Group, is believed to be behind several high-profile attacks, including the ones targeting Sony Pictures, Bangladesh’s central bank, and banks in Poland. Links have also been found between the group and the recent WannaCry ransomware attacks.
The US-CERT report focused on a DDoS tool dubbed DeltaCharlie. The organization has shared information on exploits, malware, IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules associated with Hidden Cobra in an effort to help defenders detect the group’s attacks.
Data from Arbor Networks’ ATLAS infrastructure showed that 24 of the 632 IP addresses provided by US authorities were involved in at least one DDoS attack over a 105-day period between March 1 and June 13, 2017.
The company pointed out that its ATLAS infrastructure, which relies on data shared anonymously by nearly 400 globally distributed service providers, covers roughly one-third of Internet traffic, which means the actual number of IPs involved in attacks during this period is likely higher.
According to Arbor, 16 IPs participated in more than one of the 164 attacks observed by the company. The largest attack peaked at 4.3 Gbps, which is more than enough to disrupt unprotected systems, and the longest attack lasted for 44 hours.
While the largest concentration of IP addresses in the US-CERT report were in Russia, Arbor traced the highest percentage of IPs to Saudi Arabia (6 of 24) and the United Arab Emirates (5 of 24).
The IPs monitored by Arbor were involved in DDoS attacks on most days, but there were some periods with no activity. The longest period with no activity started on April 5, shortly after North Korea launched a missile into the Sea of Japan. While it’s unclear if the two events are in any way related, experts noted that DDoS attacks are often timed with significant geopolitical events.
Of the 164 DDoS attacks observed by researchers, nearly half were aimed at the United States, followed by the U.K., Australia, France, Saudi Arabia and Singapore.
SecurityWeek has reached out to several other DDoS protection companies, but none of them could immediately provide any information on the Hidden Cobra attacks.
Arbor said it conducted an analysis due to the fact that the US-CERT report, which the company has described as vague, was not clear on whether the IPs were bots or part of command and control (C&C) infrastructure, and it also failed to clarify if the IPs were “innocent” reflectors.
Arbor’s analysis – based on the types of attacks observed – suggests that the report lists open reflectors abused by DeltaCharlie and not the actual bots.
“This lack of context makes it difficult for responders to act. Security analysts would treat a list of command-and-control servers differently from a list of bots, and differently from a list of reflectors,” experts said. “Blindly loading such indicators into security systems could potentially cause more harm than good.”
This is not the first time the cybersecurity community has criticized a joint report from the FBI and the DHS. The report released late last year on GRIZZLY STEPPE activity, better known as Cozy Bear (APT29) and Fancy Bear (APT28 and Pawn Storm), failed to demonstrate that Russia was behind the U.S. election hacks.

10,APT29,"""Man-in-the-Cloud"" Attacks Leverage Storage Services to Steal Data

Popular cloud storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox can be abused by malicious actors in what experts call “Man-in-the-Cloud” (MITC) attacks.
Imperva’s latest Hacker Intelligence Initiative report explains in detail how attackers can easily abuse common file synchronization services for command and control (C&C) communications, endpoint hacking, remote access, and data exfiltration simply by reconfiguring them.
One worrying aspect highlighted by Imperva in its report is that the attackers don’t even need to compromise targeted users’ credentials to gain access to their file synchronization accounts.
Researchers have conducted tests on Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box, cloud applications that are utilized by many organizations and their employees to make data available to multiple users and devices.
These solutions work by connecting individual devices to a central hub in the cloud through the same user account. When a file is added to a device’s local repository, it is automatically synchronized with the hub and delivered to other devices.
In an effort to make it easier to manage files, many popular applications don’t require users to enter their account credentials each time synchronization is performed. Instead, authentication to the cloud relies on a synchronization token that is usually stored in a file, a registry, or the Windows Credential Manager on the user’s machine.
The problem, according to experts, is that even though this synchronization token is encrypted on the local device, it can be easily accessed and decrypted by an attacker. Malicious actors can synchronize their own devices with the victim’s account simply by copying this token to the right place on their own system.
Imperva researcher have developed a tool that can manipulate synchronization tokens to allow an attacker to gain access to the victim’s account and implicitly their data. The tool can be delivered to the victim via phishing or drive-by download attacks, experts said.
Once they have access to the victim’s account, attackers can steal the files placed in the sync folder. In addition to stealing information, attackers can also manipulate the files located in this folder (e.g. hold them for ransom by encrypting them, plant malicious code in existing files).
Malicious actors that want to maintain access to the victim’s machine can also set up a backdoor. This can be useful for using the victim’s cloud storage as part of an operation’s C&C infrastructure.
MITC attacks have several advantages. First of all, the synchronization tokens are easy to obtain and, in some cases, the attacker can maintain access to the account even after users change their password. For example, in the case of Dropbox, the tokens are not refreshed or revoked even if the password is changed. Google Drive has a more secure design since changing the password revokes all tokens and requires users to re-authenticate each device using account credentials.
Another advantage of MITC attacks is the fact that malicious code is typically not left running on the targeted machine, and data flows out through a standard, encrypted channel, which makes it less likely to raise any suspicion, experts said. Furthermore, even if the attack is detected, the victim might have to cancel the breached account to keep hackers out.
According to Imperva, attacks based on the architecture described in the company’s report have been spotted in the wild. One example is the Inception Framework analyzed last year by researchers at Blue Coat.
There seems to be an increasing trend in the use of legitimate services by threat actors. Last month, FireEye published a report on HAMMERTOSS, a malicious backdoor leveraged by the Russian group known as APT29. HAMMERTOSS attacks involve the use of Twitter and GitHub for C&C communications, and cloud storage services for data exfiltration.
Imperva advises organizations to mitigate such attacks by using cloud access security broker solutions to identify the compromise of cloud storage accounts, and by deploying database activity monitoring (DAM) and file activity monitoring (FAM) services to identify the abuse of internal data resources.
