0,APT18,"Chinese Cyberspies Target European Drone Maker, Energy Firm

An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor believed to be based in China has been spotted targeting the systems of a European drone maker and a U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company.
Threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect has analyzed the attacks, but could not precisely determine which group is behind the campaign. The main suspects are Emissary Panda, also known as APT27 and TG-3390, and Dynamite Panda, also known as APT18, Wekby and TG-0416. It’s unclear if the hackers managed to steal any data from the targeted organizations.
Analysis of the attacks started in June, when ThreatConnect came across a variant of the HttpBrowser backdoor, which has been leveraged by both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda.
The domain used by the malware for command and control (C&C) communications is adobesys[dot]com. The email address that registered this domain at a Chinese domain reseller was previously used to register domains involved in the Anthem and OPM attacks, both of which have been attributed to China.
Researchers pointed out that both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda have targeted the defense and aerospace industries, but only the former is known to attack organizations in the energy sector.
In September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, agreed not to conduct cyber espionage for economic gain. The agreement has had some impact, but espionage operations launched from China have not ceased. FireEye reported in June that Chinese spying had dropped in volume and became more focused.
The subsidiary of the French energy management firm targeted in the attacks observed by ThreatConnect has been contracted by the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense. While targeting an energy company could constitute a violation of the September 2015 agreement, experts believe China could argue that this is in fact military espionage.
In the case of the targeted drone manufacturer, that is more likely to be an economically motivated attack. Researchers pointed out that China’s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI) is one of the world’s largest drone makers and currently holds roughly 70 percent of the market share. Targeting a European competitor can help the company maintain its position as a leader in this sector.
“While Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn’t ended and likely has evolved to help solidify leading market shares. In some ways, solidifying the dominant Chinese firm in a market feels like the next chapter in economic espionage. The overarching storyline of China’s economic espionage has been targeting strategic industries and allowing China to catch up with established champions,” ThreatConnect explained.
“China may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations that are headquartered elsewhere. Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more efficient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple intelligence requirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity as non-economic espionage, thereby adhering (with their fingers crossed) to the Rose Garden agreement,” the company added.

1,APT18,"Chinese APT Group Uses Hacking Team’s Flash Player Exploit

The Adobe Flash Player exploit stolen by hackers from spyware maker Hacking Team has been leveraged by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, according to security solutions provider Volexity.
One of the groups observed leveraging CVE-2015-5119, which Adobe patched on Wednesday morning, is known as Wekby, APT 18, Dynamite Panda and TG-0416. The threat group, believed to have Chinese roots, is the main suspect in last year’s attack on Community Health Systems. Attackers stole 4.5 million patient records from the organization, reportedly by exploiting the OpenSSL vulnerability dubbed Heartbleed.
According to Volexity, Wekby launched a spear phishing campaign involving emails titled “Important: Flash update” just as Adobe was getting ready to patch the Flash Player zero-day.
The emails were sent out using a spoofed Adobe email address and they contained a link apparently pointing to the official Adobe download domain. Users who clicked on the link were taken to a website set up to serve a malicious SWF file designed to exploit the Flash Player vulnerability in order to deliver a piece of malware.
The malware, in this case the Gh0st remote access Trojan (RAT), communicates with a Singapore IP address that has served as a command and control (C&C) server in many of Wekby’s attacks over the past years.
Labels spotted by researchers in the malicious SWF file suggest that Hacking Team is the source of the exploit.
Volexity says the Flash Player exploit has been leveraged in multiple APT and non-APT attacks.
Hackers leaked a total of 400GB of data stolen from Hacking Team, including surveillance software, source code and exploits. The Flash Player exploit was integrated into exploit kits before Adobe managed to patch the vulnerability. Trend Micro reported that the Flash flaw was exploited before the Hacking Team breach came to light in attacks apparently aimed at users in Korea.
As far as Wekby is concerned, Volexity is not the only security firm to analyze the group’s activities recently. ThreatStream issued a report on Monday detailing some of the evasive maneuvers used by the threat actor.
Researchers discovered that the group has been using variants of the HTTPBrowser tool that uses DNS as a covert channel for communications. Experts also noticed that the APT actor has been trying to complicate the analysis of their malware by using return-oriented programming (ROP) to control execution flow.",https://www.securityweek.com/chinese-apt-group-uses-hacking-team%E2%80%99s-flash-player-exploit
2,APT18,"Two New Flash Player Zero-Day Bugs Found in Hacking Team Leak

Researchers have identified exploits for two new Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerabilities in the Hacking Team leak. Adobe has promised to patch the newly discovered bugs sometime this week.
Last week, several security firms reported finding zero-day exploits for Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) and Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities in the 400GB of data stolen by hackers from the systems of Italy-based spyware maker Hacking Team. Shortly after Adobe released an update to address the Flash Player bug, researchers reported finding two additional Flash exploits in the leaked data.
One of the new Flash Player zero-days (CVE-2015-5122), involving the opaqueBackground property of the DisplayObject class in ActionScript 3, was reported to Adobe by FireEye. The security company noted that the proof-of-concept (PoC) code for this use-after-free (UAF) flaw was likely written by the author of the PoC for CVE-2015-5119.
The second unpatched UAF vulnerability (CVE-2015-5123) is related to the ActionScript 3 BitmapData object. The issue was reported to Adobe by Trend Micro and the security researcher known online as “slipstream/RoL” (@TheWack0lian).
Both of these vulnerabilities affect Flash Player 18.0.0.204 and earlier, and they allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. According to an advisory published by Adobe over the weekend, patches for these bugs will be made available in the week of July 12.
The security researcher known as Kafeine reported that the Angler exploit kit has been leveraging CVE-2015-5122 since Saturday. Other exploit kits will likely follow soon.
The first Flash Player vulnerability whose existence came to light following the Hacking Team breach was integrated into several exploit kits. The flaw was also leveraged by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors such as Wekby (APT 18) and UPS (APT3) in their operations.
In a statement published last week, Hacking Team said it was concerned that the code published by hackers allows anyone to deploy the company’s surveillance software.
“Before the attack, HackingTeam could control who had access to the technology which was sold exclusively to governments and government agencies. Now, because of the work of criminals, that ability to control who uses the technology has been lost. Terrorists, extortionists and others can deploy this technology at will if they have the technical ability to do so,” Hacking Team said. “We believe this is an extremely dangerous situation.”
Despite numerous accusations that it sold its solutions to totalitarian governments, the Italian company has denied doing anything illegal. However, the data leaked as a result of the breach appears to show that the company was well aware that its products had been used in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.
Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, has asked the European Commission and Italian authorities to investigate Hacking Team’s activities.

3,APT18,"""Wekby"" Group Uses DNS Requests for C&C Communications

Palo Alto Networks researchers noticed that a China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been using a piece of malware that leverages DNS requests for command and control (C&C) communications.
The group, known as Wekby, APT 18, Dynamite Panda and TG-0416, is believed to be responsible for the 2014 attack on Community Health Systems, one of the largest hospital operators in the United States. In that operation, the attackers reportedly stole 4.5 million patient records by exploiting the OpenSSL vulnerability dubbed Heartbleed.
The group is known to quickly add new exploits to its arsenal. One example is a Flash Player exploit that the actor started using shortly after it was leaked last year from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team.
In a more recent attack aimed at a US-based organization, Wekby leveraged a piece of malware dubbed by Palo Alto Networks “pisloader.” Based on metadata and the commands it uses, researchers believe pisloader is a variant of HTTPBrowser, a remote access Trojan (RAT) known to be used by Wekby and other APT actors.
The attackers delivered the malware using an infrastructure that includes domains made to look like they belong to major organizations such as Logitech and Global Print.
The hackers first deliver a dropper designed to add registry keys for persistence, and decrypt and execute a file that contains the pisloader payload. The payload is obfuscated using a ROP technique and contains random assembly instructions to make reverse engineering more difficult.
Pisloader uses DNS requests for C&C communications, which allows it to bypass certain security products that don’t properly inspect this type of traffic.
An increasing number of threats have been leveraging the technique, including point-of-sale (PoS) malware such as FrameworkPOS and Multigrain.
In the case of pisloader, the malware periodically sends a DNS beacon request to its C&C server, whose location is hardcoded into the malware. The DNS responses must meet certain requirements, otherwise the malware will ignore them.
The server responds with a TXT record that can contain various commands for the malware, including to collect system information, list file information for a specified directory, upload a file to the infected machine, and launch a command shell.
The commands are similar to the ones used by HTTPBrowser, which, researchers said last year, was also using DNS as a covert communications channel.
