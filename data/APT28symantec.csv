2,APT28,"APT28: New Espionage Operations Target Military and Government Organizations Recent campaigns see APT28 group return to covert intelligence gathering operations in Europe and South America. After making headlines during 2016 due to its involvement in cyber attacks against an organization involved in the U.S. presidential election, APT28 (aka Swallowtail, Fancy Bear) has continued to mount operations during 2017 and 2018. The espionage group, which according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is linked to the Russian government, returned to low-key intelligence-gathering operations during 2017 and into 2018, targeting a range of military and government targets in Europe and South America. History of disruptive attacks APT28 has been active since at least January 2007 but received public attention in a major way during 2016 when it was implicated in a series of cyber attacks in the run up to the U.S. presidential election. Beginning in the Spring of 2016, APT28 sent spear-phishing emails to political targets including members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These emails were designed to trick recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The attack group then used these stolen credentials to gain access to the DNC network, install malware, move across the network, and steal data, including a trove of emails. The compromised information was later leaked online. These election attacks signaled a change of tactics on the part of APT28, moving away from their prior low-key intelligence gathering towards more overt activity, seemingly intended to destabilize and disrupt victim organizations and countries. The group was also responsible for the 2016 attack on the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and the leaking of confidential drug testing information. In keeping with its shift to more overt tactics, the group appeared to publicly take credit for the attack, leaking the information on a website using the name “Fancy Bears”, an industry codename that was already widely used for the group. Return to the shadows After receiving an unprecedented amount of attention in 2016, APT28 has continued to mount operations during 2017 and 2018. However, the group’s activities since the beginning of 2017 have again become more covert and appear to be mainly motivated by intelligence gathering. The organizations targeted by APT28 during 2017 and 2018 include: A well-known international organization Military targets in Europe Governments in Europe A government of a South American country An embassy belonging to an Eastern European country Ongoing development of tools APT28 uses a number of tools to compromise its targets. The group’s primary malware is Sofacy, which has two main components. Trojan.Sofacy (also known as Seduploader) performs basic reconnaissance on an infected computer and can download further malware. Backdoor.SofacyX (also known as X-Agent) is a second stage piece of malware, capable of stealing information from the infected computer. A Mac version of the Trojan also exists (OSX.Sofacy). APT28 has continued to develop its tools over the past two years. For example, Trojan.Shunnael (aka X-Tunnel), malware used to maintain access to infected networks using an encrypted tunnel, underwent a rewrite to .NET. In addition to this, as reported by our peers at ESET last week, the group has also begun using a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known as Lojax. Because the rootkit resides within a computer’s flash memory, it allows the attackers to maintain a persistent presence on a compromised machine even if the hard drive is replaced or the operating system is reinstalled. Symantec products block attempts to install Lojax with the detection name Trojan.Lojax. Possible links to other espionage operations Another attack group, Earworm (aka Zebrocy), has been active since at least May 2016 and is involved in what appears to be intelligence gathering operations against military targets in Europe, Central Asia, and Eastern Asia. The group uses spear-phishing emails to compromise its targets and infect them with malware. Earworm uses two malware tools. Trojan.Zekapab is a downloader component that is capable of carrying out basic reconnaissance functions and downloading additional malware to the infected computer. Backdoor.Zekapab is installed on selected infected computers and is capable of taking screenshots, executing files and commands, uploading and downloading files, performing registry and file system operations, and carrying out system information tasks. Earworm has also on occasion installed additional tools onto infected computers for the purposes of keylogging and password capture. During 2016, Symantec observed some overlap between the command and control (C&C) infrastructure used by Earworm and the C&C infrastructure used by Grizzly Steppe (the U.S. government code name for APT28 and related actors), implying a potential connection between Earworm and APT28. However, Earworm also appears to conduct separate operations from APT28 and thus Symantec tracks them as a distinct group. An ongoing threat It is now clear that after being implicated in the U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016, APT28 was undeterred by the resulting publicity and continues to mount further attacks using its existing tools. After its foray into overt and disruptive attacks in 2016, the group has subsequently returned to its roots, mounting intelligence gathering operations against a range of targets. This ongoing activity and the fact that APT28 continues to refine its toolset means that the group will likely continue to pose a significant threat to nation state targets. Protection Symantec has had the following protections in place to protect customers against APT28 attacks: Trojan.Sofacy Backdoor.SofacyX Infostealer.Sofacy OSX.Sofacy Trojan.Shunnael Trojan.Lojax The following protections are in place to protect customers against Earworm attacks: Trojan.Zekapab Backdoor.Zekapab Threat Intelligence Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on the “Swallowtail” (also known as APT28), which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.",https://www.symantec.com/blogs/election-security/apt28-espionage-military-government
3,APT28,"Subverting Democracy: How Cyber Attackers Try to Hack the Vote Everything you need to know about APT28 and APT29, the attackers that attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. midterm elections are taking place on November 6 and, given what happened in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, many voters may be concerned about whether foreign espionage actors will once again attempt to influence the vote. Cyber attacks played a central role in the 2016 campaign, creating some of the main controversies of the campaign. Multiple organizations were targeted, with the most talked about incident being the attack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) which resulted in nearly 20,000 internal emails being leaked. With the midterm elections now around the corner, there are naturally concerns about further attacks. Here’s a short primer on the 2016 attacks and what tactics were used by the attackers: How can cyber espionage groups interfere with elections? While there are many ways a cyber espionage actor could potentially interfere with an election, proven cases to date have involved compromising targeted organizations in order to steal and leak information in the hope that it could influence the outcome and/or sow distrust in the political process. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, two cyber espionage groups—APT28 and APT29 —compromised a number of political targets, including the DNC, and stole a cache of information, including a large number of emails. These emails were then leaked online, and their contents became a significant talking point during the campaign. According to the U.S. government, both APT28 and APT29 are linked to the Russian government. Who is APT28? APT28 (aka Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Swallowtail, Tsar Team, Sednit) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group which has been active since at least January 2007. The group was initially known for traditional, information-stealing espionage campaigns, targeting governments in the U.S. and Europe. It became involved in more overt, disruptive operations in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It was also responsible for the 2016 attack on the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and subsequent leak of drug testing information. How does APT28 infiltrate targets? The group has been known to employ a variety of methods to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. These include spear-phishing emails, watering hole websites, infected storage devices, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT28 used spear-phishing emails that tricked recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The group then used these stolen credentials to gain access to email accounts and steal the contents. This information was later leaked. What tools does APT28 use? Symantec has seen APT28 use a number of custom malware tools, including: Infostealer.Sofacy OSX.Sofacy Trojan.Sofacy Trojan.Modruner Who is APT29? APT29 (aka Cozy Bear, Fritillary, the Dukes) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group which has been active since at least January 2010. Like APT28, it initially confined itself to spying campaigns, focusing on governments, the military, and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe. It later became involved in more subversive operations and was implicated (along with APT28) in disruptive attacks prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. How does APT29 infiltrate targets? APT29 usually relies on spear-phishing emails to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT29 sent spear-phishing emails to over 1,000 targeted individuals, including some U.S. government personnel. These emails contained malicious links which, if clicked, would lead to malware being installed on the target’s computer. This allowed APT29 to compromise a political party’s systems and steal emails from several accounts on the network. What tools does APT29 use? Symantec has seen APT29 use a number of custom malware tools, including: Trojan.Cozer Trojan.Seaduke Trojan.Dionisduke Backdoor.Netduke Trojan.Powerduke Backdoor.Miniduke Has Symantec previously published research on APT29? Yes, in July 2015 we published a blog: “Forkmeiamfamous”: Seaduke, latest weapon in the Duke armory How likely are we to see a repeat of these tactics during the 2018 midterm U.S. elections? Given the impact the 2016 attacks had, there is a strong likelihood that these tactics may be used again in a bid to sow discord and confusion among voters. How has the link between APT28, APT29, and Russia been established? The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have concluded that both groups are linked to the Russian government. Symantec has no evidence that conflicts with this conclusion. What is the difference between APT28 and APT29? The groups are believed to be linked to different Russian agencies. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has indicted 12 alleged members of Russia’s military intelligence agency (known as GRU) for activity relating to the APT28 attacks.",https://www.symantec.com/blogs/election-security/election-hacking-faq
