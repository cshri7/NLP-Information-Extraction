0,APT1,"Download the Kaspersky Security Bulletin: Threat Predictions for 2018  Introduction  As hard as it is to believe, it’s once again time for our APT Predictions. Looking back at a year like 2017 brings the internal conflict of being a security researcher into full view: on the one hand, each new event is an exciting new research avenue for us, as what were once theoretical problems find palpable expression in reality. This allows us to understand the actual attack surface and attacker tactics and to further hone our hunting and detection to address new attacks. On the other hand, as people with a heightened concern for the security posture of users at large, each event is a bigger catastrophe. Rather than consider each new breach as yet another example of the same, we see the compounding cumulative insecurity facing users, e-commerce, financial, and governmental institutions alike.  As we stated last year, rather than thinly-veiled vendor pitching, our predictions are an attempt to bring to bear our research throughout the year in the form of trends likely to peak in the coming year.  Our record – did we get it right?  As a snapshot scorecard of our performance last year, these are some of our 2017 predictions and some examples where relevant:  Espionage and APTs:   Passive implants showing almost no signs of infection come into fashion Yes – https://securelist.com/unraveling-the-lamberts-toolkit/77990/  Ephemeral infections / memory malware Yes – https://securelist.com/fileless-attacks-against-enterprise-networks/77403/  Espionage goes mobile Yes – https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/an-investigation-of-chrysaor-malware-on.html   Financial Attacks:   The future of financial attacks Yes – https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/   Ransomware:   Dirty, lying ransomware Yes – https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/   Industrial threats:   The ICS Armageddon didn’t come yet (and we are happy to be wrong on that), however, we’ve seen ICS come under attack from Industoyer – https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/   IoT:   A brick by any other name Yes! BrickerBot – https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/   Information Warfare:   Yes, multiple examples – https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/   What can we expect in 2018?   More supply chain attacks. Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team tracks over 100 APT (advanced persistent threat) groups and operations. Some of these are incredibly sophisticated and possess wide arsenals that include zero-day exploits, fileless attack tools, and combine traditional hacking attacks with handovers to more sophisticated teams that handle the exfiltration part. We have often seen cases in which advanced threat actors have attempted to breach a certain target over a long period of time and kept failing at it. This was either due to the fact that the target was using strong internet security suites, had educated their employees not to fall victim to social engineering, or consciously followed the Australian DSD TOP35 mitigation strategies for APT attacks. In general, an actor that is considered both advanced and persistent won’t give up that easily, they’ll continue poking the defenses until they find a way in. When everything else fails, they are likely to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. During such a re-evaluation, threat actors can decide a supply chain attack can be more effective than trying to break into their target directly. Even a target whose networks employ the world’s best defenses is likely using software from a third-party. The third party might be an easier target and can be leveraged to attack the better protected original target enterprise.  During 2017, we have seen several such cases, including but not limited to:   Shadowpad  CCleaner  ExPetr / NotPetya   These attacks can be extremely difficult to identify or mitigate. For instance, in the case of Shadowpad, the attackers succeeded in Trojanizing a number of packages from Netsarang that were widely used around world, in banks, large enterprises, and other industry verticals. The difference between the clean and Trojanized packages can be dauntingly difficult to notice –in many cases it’s the command and control (C&C) traffic that gives them away.  For CCleaner, it was estimated that over 2 million computers received the infected update, making it one of the biggest attacks of 2017. Analysis of the malicious CCleaner code allowed us to correlate it with a couple of other backdoors that are known to have been used in the past by APT groups from the ‘Axiom umbrella’, such as APT17 also known as Aurora. This proves the now extended lengths to which APT groups are willing to go in order to accomplish their objectives.  Our assessment is that the amount of supply chain attacks at the moment is probably much higher than we realize but these have yet to be noticed or exposed. During 2018, we expect to see more supply chain attacks, both from the point of discovery and as well as actual attacks. Trojanizing specialized software used in specific regions and verticals will become a move akin to waterholing strategically chosen sites in order to reach specific swaths of victims and will thus prove irresistible to certain types of attackers.  More high-end mobile malware. In August 2016, CitizenLab and Lookout published their analysis of the discovery of a sophisticated mobile espionage platform named Pegasus. Pegasus, a so-called ‘lawful interception’ software suite, is sold to governments and other entities by an Israeli company called NSO Group. When combined with zero-days capable of remotely bypassing a modern mobile operating systems’ security defenses, such as iOS, this is a highly potent system against which there is little defense.  In April 2017, Google published its analysis of the Android version of the Pegasus spyware which it called Chrysaor . In addition to ‘lawful surveillance’ spyware such as Pegasus and Chrysaor, many other APT groups have developed their own mobile malware implants. Due to the fact that iOS is an operating system locked down from introspection, there is very little that a user can do to check if their phone is infected. Somehow, despite the greater state of vulnerability of Android, the situation is better on Android where products such as Kaspersky AntiVirus for Android are available to ascertain the integrity of a device.  Our assessment is that the total number of mobile malware existing in the wild is likely higher than currently reported, due to shortcomings in telemetry that makes these more difficult to spot and eradicate. We estimate that in 2018 more high-end APT malware for mobile will be discovered, as a result of both an increase in the attacks and improvement in security technologies designed to catch them.  More BeEF-like compromises with web profiling. Due to a combination of increased interest and better security and mitigation technologies being deployed by default in operating systems, the prices of zero-day exploits have skyrocketed through 2016 and 2017. For instance, the latest Zerodium payout chart lists up to $1,500,000 for a complete iPhone (iOS) Remote jailbreak with persistence attack, which is another way of saying ‘a remote infection without any interaction from the user’.  The incredible prices that some government customers have most certainly chosen to pay for these exploits mean there is increasing attention paid towards protecting these exploits from accidental disclosure. This translates into the implementation of a more solid reconnaissance phase before delivering the actual attack components. The reconnaissance phase can, for instance emphasize the identification of the exact versions of the browser used by the target, their operating system, plugins and other third-party software. Armed with this knowledge, the threat actor can fine tune their exploit delivery to a less sensitive ‘1-day’ or ‘N-day’ exploit, instead of using the crown jewels .  These profiling techniques have been fairly consistent with APT groups like Turla and Sofacy , as well as Newsbeef (a.k.a. Newscaster, Ajax hacking team, or  ‘Charming Kitten’), but also other APT groups known for their custom profiling frameworks, such as the prolific Scanbox. Taking the prevalence of these frameworks into account in combination with a surging need to protect expensive tools, we estimate the usage of profiling toolkits such as ‘BeEF ‘ will increase in 2018 with more groups adopting either public frameworks or developing their own.  Sophisticated UEFI and BIOS attacks. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a software interface which serves as the intermediary between the firmware and the operating system on modern PCs. Established in 2005 by an alliance of leading software and hardware developers, Intel most notable amongst them, it’s now quickly superseding the legacy BIOS standard. This was achieved thanks to a number of advanced features that BIOS lacks: for example, the ability to install and run executables, networking and Internet capabilities, cryptography, CPU-independent architecture and drivers, etc. The very advanced capabilities that make UEFI such an attractive platform also open the way to new vulnerabilities that didn’t exist in the age of the more rigid BIOS. For example, the ability to run custom executable modules makes it possible to create malware that would be launched by UEFI directly before any anti-malware solution – or, indeed, the OS itself – had a chance to start. The fact that commercial-grade UEFI malware exists has been known since 2015, when the Hacking team UEFI modules were discovered. With that in mind, it is perhaps surprising that no significant UEFI malware has been found, a fact that we attribute to the difficulty in detecting these in a reliable way. We estimate that in 2018 we will see the discovery of more UEFI-based malware.  Destructive attacks continue. Beginning in November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new wave of wiper attacks directed at multiple targets in the Middle East. The malware used in the new attacks was a variant of the infamous Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and Rasgas back in 2012. Dormant for four years, one of the most mysterious wipers in history has returned. Also known as Disttrack, Shamoon is a highly destructive malware family that effectively wipes the victim machine. A group known as the ‘Cutting Sword of Justice’ took credit for the Saudi Aramco attack by posting a Pastebin message on the day of the attack (back in 2012), and justified the attack as a measure against the Saudi monarchy. The Shamoon 2.0 attacks seen in November 2016 targeted organizations in various critical and economic sectors in Saudi Arabia. Just like the previous variant, the Shamoon 2.0 wiper aims for the mass destruction of systems inside compromised organizations. While investigating the Shamoon 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky Lab also discovered a previously unknown wiper malware that appears to be targeting organizations in Saudi Arabia. We’ve called this new wiper StoneDrill and have been able to link it with a high degree of confidence to the Newsbeef APT group.  In addition to Shamoon and Stonedrill, 2017 has been a tough year in terms of destructive attacks. The ExPetr/NotPetya attack, which was initially considered to be ransomware , turned out to be a cleverly camouflaged wiper as well. ExPetr was followed by other waves of ‘ransomware’ attacks, in which there is little chance for the victims to recover their data; all cleverly masked ‘wipers as ransomware’. One of the lesser known facts about ‘wipers as ransomware’ is perhaps that a wave of such attacks was observed in 2016 from the CloudAtlas APT, which leveraged what appeared to be ‘wipers as ransomware’ against financial institutions in Russia.  In 2018, we estimate that destructive attacks will continue to rise, leveraging its status as the most visible type of cyberwarfare.  More subversion of cryptography. In March 2017, IoT encryption scheme proposals developed by the NSA came into question with Simon and Speck variant ISO approvals being both withdrawn and delayed a second time . In August 2016, Juniper Networks announced the discovery of two mysterious backdoors in their NetScreen firewalls. Perhaps the most interesting of the two was an extremely subtle change of the constants used for the Dual_EC random number generator, which would allow a knowledgeable attacker to decrypt VPN traffic from NetScreen devices. The original Dual_EC algorithm was designed by the NSA and pushed through NIST. Back in 2013, a Reuters report suggested that NSA paid RSA $10 million to put the vulnerable algorithm in their products as a means of subverting encryption. Even if the theoretical possibility of a backdoor was identified as early as 2007, several companies (including Juniper) continued to use it with a different set of constants, which would make it theoretically secure. It appears that this different set of constants made some APT actor unhappy enough to merit hacking into Juniper and changing the constants to a set that they could control and leverage to decrypt VPN connections.  These attempts haven’t gone unnoticed. In September 2017, an international group of cryptography experts have forced the NSA to back down on two new encryption algorithms, which the organization was hoping to standardize.  In October 2017, news broke about a flaw in a cryptographic library used by Infineon in their hardware chips for generation of RSA primes. While the flaw appears to have been unintentional, it does leave the question open in regards to how secure are the underlying encryption technologies used in our everyday life, from smart cards, wireless networks or encrypted web traffic. In 2018, we predict that more severe cryptographic vulnerabilities will be found and (hopefully) patched, be they in the standards themselves or the specific implementations.  Identity in e-commerce comes into crisis. The past few years have been punctuated by increasingly catastrophic large-scale breaches of personally identifiable information (PII). Latest among these is the Equifax breach reportedly affecting 145.5 million Americans.  While many have grown desensitized to the weight of these breaches, it’s important to understand that the release of PII at scale endangers a fundamental pillar of e-commerce and the bureaucratic convenience of adopting the Internet for important paperwork. Sure, fraud and identity theft have been problems for a long time, but what happens when the fundamental identifying information is so widely proliferated that it’s simply not reliable at all? Commerce and governmental institutions (particularly in the United States) will be faced with a choice between scaling back the modern comforts of adopting the Internet for operations or doubling down on the adoption of other multi-factor solutions. Perhaps thus far resilient alternatives like ApplePay will come into vogue as de facto means of insuring identity and transactions, but in the meantime we may see a slowdown in the critical role of the Internet for modernizing tedious bureaucratic processes and cutting operational costs.  More router and modem hacks. Another known area of vulnerability that has gone vastly ignored is that of routers and modems. Be they home or enterprise, these pieces of hardware are everywhere, they’re critically important to daily operations, and tend to run proprietary pieces of software that go unpatched and unwatched. At the end of the day, these little computers are Internet-facing by design and thereby sitting at a critical juncture for an attacker intent on gaining persistent and stealthy access to a network. Moreover, as some very cool recent research has shown , in some cases attackers might even be able to impersonate different Internet users, making it possible to throw off the trail of an attacker entirely to a different connecting address. At a time of increased interest in misdirection and false flags, this is no small feat. Greater scrutiny of these devices will inevitably yield some interesting findings.  A medium for social chaos. Beyond the leaks and political drama of the past year’s newfound love for information warfare, social media itself has taken a politicized role beyond our wildest dreams. Whether it’s at the hand of political pundits or confusing comedic jabs at Facebook’s CEO by South Park’s writers, eyes have turned against the different social media giants demanding some level of fact-checking and identification of fake users and bots attempting to exert disproportionate levels of social influence. Sadly, it’s becoming obvious that these networks (which base their success on quantified metrics like ‘daily active users’) have little incentive to truly purge their user base of bots. Even when these bots are serving an obvious agenda or can be tracked and traced by independent researchers. We expect that as the obvious abuse continues and large bot networks become accessible to wider swaths of politically unsavory characters, that the greater backlash will be directed at the use of social media itself, with disgusted users eagerly looking for alternatives to the household giants that revel in the benefits of the abuse for profits and clicks.   APT predictions – conclusion  In 2017 we pronounced the death of Indicators of Compromise . In 2018, we expect to see advanced threat actors playing to their new strengths, honing their new tools and the terrifying angles described above.  Each year’s themes and trends shouldn’t be taken in isolation – they build on each other to enrich an ever-growing landscape of threats facing users of all types, be it individuals, enterprise, or government. The only consistent reprieve from this onslaught is the sharing and knowledgeable application of high-fidelity threat intelligence.  While these predictions cover trends for advanced targeted threats, individual industry sectors will face their own distinct challenges. In 2018, we wanted to shine the spotlight on some of those as well – and have prepared predictions for the connected healthcare, automotive, financial services, and industrial security sectors, as well as cryptocurrencies.

1,APT1,"Download the full report (PDF)  Targeted attacks and malware campaigns  Cha-ching! Skimming off the cream  Earlier in the year, as part of an incident response investigation, we uncovered a new version of the Skimer ATM malware",https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-in-q2-2016-overview/75615/
2,APT1,"CVE-2015-2545 is a vulnerability discovered in 2015 and corrected with Microsoft’s update MS15-099. The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office versions 2007 SP3, 2010 SP2, 2013 SP1 and 2013 RT SP1.  The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.  The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was used in a targeted attack by the Platinum group , presumably against targets in India. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.  In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups.  Overview of groups using CVE-2015-2545   Platinum (also known as TwoForOne)  The group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India.  This group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. After the vulnerability was corrected with Microsoft updates in September and November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been detected.  Microsoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in February 2016, and in its paper: PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia .  APT16  The group has been known for several years and is believed to be of Chinese origin. In November and December 2015, it used a modified exploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye research paper – The EPS Awakens – Part 2 .  EvilPost  In December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack against the Japanese defense sector. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download additional malware components from the C&C server.  The C&C server used in the attack was located in Japan and appears to have been compromised. However, there is no indication that it has ever been used for any other malicious purpose. Monitoring of the server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new findings. We believe the attackers either lost access to the server or realized that it resulted in too much attention from security researchers, as the attack was widely discussed by the Japanese security community.  According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a Word document attached.  This document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a vulnerability in the EPS format handler in Microsoft Word. Even with an exploit component, Microsoft Word rendered the document correctly and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below.   It has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related organizations.  This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.  An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence Service in March 2016. For information about the service, please write to intelreports@kaspersky.com .  SPIVY  In March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The emails were sent in spear-phishing attacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong. Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because they used a new variant of a widely available backdoor known as PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A description of these incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog .  Danti and SVCMONDR  These two groups have not yet been publicly described. An overview of their attacks and the tools used is provided in this report.   Danti attacks  Danti (Kaspersky Lab’s internal name) is an APT actor that has been active at least since 2015, predominantly targeting Indian government organizations. According to our telemetry, Danti has also been actively hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines",https://securelist.com/cve-2015-2545-overview-of-current-threats/74828/
3,APT1,"Q1 in figures   According to KSN data, Kaspersky Lab products detected and neutralized 1 345 570 352 threats in Q1 2013.  A total of 22,750 new modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected this past quarter — that’s more than half of the total number of modifications detected in all of 2012.  Some 40% of the exploits seen in the first quarter of this year target vulnerabilities in Adobe products.  Nearly 60% of all malicious hosts are located in three countries: the US, Russia, and the Netherlands.   Overview  The first quarter of 2013 turned out to be a busy time in IT security. This report will address the most significant events.  Cyberespionage and cyberweapons  Red October  At the very beginning of the year, Kaspersky Lab published a significant report with the results of a study on the global cyberespionage operation known as Red October . These attacks targeted various government agencies, diplomatic organizations and companies around the world. Analyzing the files and reconstructing the structure of the attack took several months. However, after a labor-intensive study, we were able to determine several key facts.  The attackers have been active over the past five years. The multifunctional platform that they used helped them quickly use new, expanded modules to collect information. In order to control and manage infected systems, they created more than 60 different domain names and several servers hosted in different countries. The command sever infrastructure is comprised of a chain of proxy servers.  In addition to traditional targeted attacks on workstations, Red October is also capable of stealing data from mobile devices, collecting data from network equipment, collecting files from USB drives, stealing email databases from local Outlook archives or from remote POP/IMAP servers, and extracting files from local FTP servers on the Internet.  MiniDuke  In February, FireEye published an analysis of a new malicious program that penetrates systems using a 0-day vulnerability in Adobe Reader (CVE-2013-0640). This became the first exploit capable of bypassing the Acrobat Reader sandbox. It downloaded a backdoor meant to steal data from an infected system. After obtaining examples of this malicious program for analysis, we gave it the name ItaDuke.  In time, we discovered several similar incidents targeting the very same vulnerability, only with different threats. The malicious program used by the cybercriminals was dubbed MiniDuke. An investigation into these incidents was conducted by the Hungarian company CrySys Lab. MiniDuke’s victims turned out to be government agencies located in Ukraine, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic and Ireland, as well as a research organization in Hungary, in addition to a research institute, two scientific research centers and a medical facility in the US. In total, we detected 59 victims in 23 countries.  One of the most interesting characteristics of the MiniDuke attacks was the combination of a threat with code written using a complex, ‘old school’ approach, and relatively new, yet tried-and-true, exploit technologies targeting Adobe Reader vulnerabilities.  The attackers sent out malicious PDF documents with exploits targeting versions 9 through 11 of Adobe Reader. The documents contained information about a seminar on human rights (ASEM), news about Ukraine’s foreign policy, and the plans of NATO countries. If an exploit was successful, the victim’s computer would be infiltrated by a unique backdoor, small at just 20 KB, written in Assembler.  The cybercriminals used Twitter in this attack: in order to obtain C&C server addresses and subsequently download new malicious modules, the backdoor sought out special tweets from previously created accounts. As soon as the infected system established a connection with the command server, it would begin to receive encrypted modules (backdoors) bundled with GIF files. These modules had relatively simple functions: copying, moving and deleting files, creating directories, and downloading new malicious programs.  APT1  In February, Mandiant published a large PDF report on the attacks launched by a certain group of Chinese hackers going by the name of APT1. The term APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is still a buzz word. Yet sometimes it refers to threats or attacks that aren’t exactly “advanced”. However, in the case of APT1, “advanced” is no exaggeration — this campaign run by Chinese hackers is large-scale and not to be taken lightly.  The Mandiant reports starts off by stating that APT1 appears to be a division of the Chinese army. The company even included a possible physical address for the division, and estimated the number of people involved and the infrastructure used. Mandiant believes that APT1 has been operating since 2006, and that over the course of 6 years it has managed to steal terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations. The victim organizations are primarily located in English-speaking countries. No doubt these massive attacks would not have been possible without real support from hundreds of people and a developed, modern infrastructure.  This is definitely not the first time that China has faced accusations of its involvement of cyberattacks against government agencies and organizations in countries around the world. And there is nothing particularly surprising about the Chinese government’s firm rejection of the assertions made in the Mandiant report.  Note that up till now, no country has ever claimed responsibility for any cyberespionage attack, or has admitted to involvement in cyberespionage under pressure from public or agency evidence.  TeamSpy  In March 2013, information was published about the latest in a line of complex attacks targeting high-ranking politicians and human rights advocates in the CIS and Eastern Europe. The operation was dubbed “ TeamSpy ,” as the remote admin program TeamViewer was used by the attackers to control victim computers. The main objective of this attack was to gather information from user computers, starting with screenshots and ending with copies of .pgp files, including passwords and encryption keys.  Even though the tools used in the TeamSpy operation — and even the operation itself — didn’t seem all that sophisticated or professional compared to the Red October operation, the TeamSpy attacks were also successful.  Stuxnet 0.5  Incidents that require months of persistent effort to investigate are relatively rare in the antivirus industry. Even rarer are events that remain relevant even three years after they take place — like the detection of Stuxnet, for example. Although this worm has been studied by numerous antivirus companies, there are still many modules that have barely been examined, if at all. It is important to remember that there were several version of Stuxnet, and that the earliest of them appeared back in 2009. Experts suggested several times that there were (or still are) even earlier versions of this worm, although there was no hard evidence.  But in the end, those assertions were confirmed. In late February, Symantec published a study on a new “old” version of the worm — Stuxnet 0.5. This version turned out to be the earliest known modification of Stuxnet, and was active between 2007 and 2009. Furthermore, this version had some very interesting characteristics:   First of all, it was created on the same platform as Flame, not Tilded like subsequent Stuxnet modifications.  Second, the worm spread using infected files generated with Simatic Step 7 , and did not contain any exploits for Microsoft products.  Third, Stuxnet 0.5 was no longer proliferated after July 4, 2009 .  Finally, it was Stuxnet 0.5 that featured complete compatibility with Siemens 417 PLC (later versions of the work did not have this feature in full).   The results of the study of Stuxnet version 0.5 have provided more information about this malicious program in general. It’s likely that we will find out even more information in the future. The same can be said about examples of cyberweapons detected after Stuxnet, as well as malware used in cyberespionage — there’s a lot we still don’t know.  Targeted attacks  Attacks against Tibetan and Uyghur activists  In the first quarter of 2013, targeted attacks continued against Tibetan and Uyghur activists. In order to achieve their goals, the attackers used everything at their disposal, and users of Mac OS X, Windows, and Android were subjected to attacks.  In January-February, Kaspersky Lab detected a substantial increase in the number of targeted attacks on Uyghurs using Mac OS X. All of these attacks used the CVE-2009-0562 vulnerability, which was patched by Microsoft nearly four years ago. The exploit for this vulnerability was sent out in MS Office documents, which were easy to recognize from the “captain” author tag. If the exploit was successfully executed, a backdoor for Mac OS X was downloaded in the form of a Mach-O file. This small backdoor has a very specific function: it installs another backdoor and a program that steals personal data (contacts).  Kaspersky Lab recorded the attacks against the Tibetan activists in mid-March 2013. This time, the attackers used the exploit mentioned above (CVE-2013-0640 — previously used in ItaDuke attacks) to get around the sandbox in Acrobat Reader X and infect the targeted computers.  In late March 2013, users of Android devices also fell victim to this wave of attacks. After the inbox of a well-known Tibetan activist was hacked, mailings from his address started coming out with an APK file attachment, which turned out to be a malicious program for Android (Kaspersky Lab products have labeled it Backdoor.AndroidOS.Chuli.a). This threat stealthily notifies its command server of a successful infection, and then begins to collect data stored on the device: contacts, call logs, text messages, GPS data and device information. Then the malware encrypts the stolen data using Base64 and uploads it to the command server. Kaspersky Lab’s investigation of the command server shows that the attackers speak Chinese.  Just a few days after the results of our study were published, research organization The Citizen Lab published the results of its study of a similar incident. The target of the attack were people who were in one way or another associated with Tibet or Tibetan activists, and the malicious program that was used has a similar function (stealing personal information), but is an infected version of the Kakao Talk messenger.  Hacking corporate networks  Unfortunately, the first quarter of the year turned out to be chock full of incidents involving hacked corporate infrastructures and password leakages. Victims included Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Evernote, among others.  In early February, Twitter made an official announcement that malicious users had managed to steal user data (including hash passwords) from 250,000 members of the social network. Two weeks later, Facebook issued a statement that the computers of several of the company’s staff members had been infected by exploits during visits to a mobile developer site. Facebook described this as a sophisticated, targeted attack, noting that the goal was to penetrate Facebook’s corporate network. Luckily, company representatives stated that Facebook was able to avoid any leakage of user information.  Just a few days later, Apple announced that several company employees had fallen victim to the very same attack while visiting a website for mobile developers. Apple’s data showed that no data leakages had taken place. In early March, Evernote reported that their internal network had been hacked and that malicious users had attempted to gain access to their data.  In 2011, we witnessed mass hacking of various companies and mass user data leakages. It might seem like these attacks all came to nothing — but not so! Malicious users remain as interested as ever in hacking large companies and getting their hands on confidential data, including user information.  Mobile threats  Kaspersky Lab’s report on the evolution of threats targeting smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices in 2012 was published in February 2013. Our data shows that in 2012 Android became the number-one target among virus writers, and that the number of threats over the course of the year grew steadily. Has this upswing in the number of mobile threats continued in 2013 so far? Indeed it has.  A few numbers  January is traditionally a quiet month for mobile virus writers — “only” 1,262 new modifications appeared in the first month of the year. But over the past few months, Kaspersky Lab has detected over 20,000 new mobile malware modifications. In February, we detected 12,044 mobile malware modifications, and another 9,443 in March. To compare — a total of 40,059 modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected over the whole of 2012.  SMS Trojans, which send unauthorized text messages to short, premium-rate numbers, are still the most prevalent category of mobile threats and currently represent 63.6% of all attacks.  A total of 99.9% of new mobile threat detections target the Android platform.  According to KSN data, the Top 20 most commonly used malicious or potentially unwanted programs for Android are:      Rank  Name  % of all attacks    1  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a  29,45%    2  Trojan.AndroidOS.Plangton.a  18,78%    3  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a  12,23%    4  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.bo  11,49%    5  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.a  3,43%    6  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.u  2,54%    7  RiskTool.AndroidOS.AveaSMS.a  1,79%    8  Monitor.AndroidOS.Walien.a  1,60%    9  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.ei  1,24%    10  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.aq  1,10%    11  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ay  1,08%    12  Trojan.AndroidOS.Fakerun.a  0,78%    13  Monitor.AndroidOS.Trackplus.a  0,75%    14  Adware.AndroidOS.Copycat.a  0,69%    15  Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Fav.a  0,66%    16  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.ee  0,55%    17  HackTool.AndroidOS.Penetho.a  0,54%    18  RiskTool.AndroidOS.SMSreg.b  0,52%    19  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.aa  0,48%    20  HackTool.AndroidOS.FaceNiff.a  0,43%      First place this past quarter goes to Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a (29.45%). This threat targets primarily Russian speaking Internet users attempting to download software for Android devices from dubious sites. Often, cybercriminals use these websites to spread malware under the guise of useful software.  (18.78%), an adware Trojan ranked second. This threat is seen primarily in European countries, where it is used by the developers of free software to monetize products by displaying ads.  Third and fourth place both went to SMS Trojans from the Opfake family: Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a (12.23%) and Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.bo (11.49%). The first modifications of the Opfake family of threats were disguised as the latest version of Opera, a popular mobile browser. Today, the malicious programs in this family are disguised as new versions of other popular apps (Skype, Angry Birds, etc.).  Incidents  We would like to touch on two of the most interesting virus incidents of the first quarter this year:   a new threat going by the name of Perkele or Perkel, which hunts for mTANs,  and the MTK botnet.   Another important event that took place this past quarter was the targeted attacks against Android users that we addressed above.  Perkel  During the first two weeks of March, the well-known journalist Brian Krebs detected information on underground Russian-language forums about a new banking Trojan targeting mobile devices and allegedly affecting users in 69 countries. As rumor had it, the new threat had already infected no small number of devices. Krebs suggested that this Trojan was created by Russian speaking virus writers, since the combination of tools used to create it are made available on Russian-language forums.  This news naturally drew the attention of antivirus professionals, but no examples of the software were available for a while.  Several days later, the first modifications of Perkel were detected. After Kaspersky Lab performed an analysis, it became clear that there were some new additions to the family of malicious programs designed to steal text messages containing mTANs. The functions seen in the Perkel family are typical of this group, with two exceptions:   Perkel tends to use text messages rather than HTTP to communicate with the command server and upload stolen data (in addition to text messages with mTANs, the threat also collects information about the infected device).  The threat is capable of performing self-updates by downloading a new copy of itself from a remote server.   The MTK Botnet  In mid-January, word came out about the existence of a botnet that had infected up to one million Android devices owned primarily by Chinese users. As it turned out, the spread of a malicious program in China was at the root of the botnet (Kaspersky Lab has dubbed this malicious program Trojan.AndroidOS.MTK). It spread via unofficial Chinese app stores with popular, cracked games. In addition to stealing information about the infected smartphone, user contact data and messages, threats in this family also hype up a variety of apps. To do so, the Trojans stealthily download and install apps on the victim’s mobile device, and then give that app the highest possible rating in the app store. Then, they report their actions to a remote server. The number of apps for Android is constantly on the rise, and it is often a challenge to gain popularity with users — which is why these illegitimate tactics are becoming all the more common.  TurkTrust’s certificates revoked  In the first quarter of 2013, we saw yet another incident involving root certificates . Microsoft, Mozilla, and Google all revoked two root certificates issued by the certificate authority TurkTrust, thus removing them from their respective browser databases.  As it turned out, TurkTrust had released redundant root certificates to two organizations in place of typical SSL certificates. They could be used to make SSL certificates for any resource on the Internet, and the browsers used to access these resources would accept these certificates as ‘trusted’.  In December, Google found that one of the certificates issued by TurkTrust SSL for *.google.com had been involved in a “man-in-the-middle” type attack. Naturally, the fact that Google had been attacked meant that the certificates issued in the same way could be involved in attacks against other companies.  This latest in a line of major incidents related to root certificates and trust issues has shown that the malicious use of legitimate certificates remains a critical problem. However, the malicious usage of these types of certificates has only ever been identified after the fact, as currently there are no effective means of preventing these types of incidents at this time.  Statistics  em>All statistical data used in the report has been obtained from the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). The statistics were acquired from KSN users who consented to share their local data. Millions of users of Kaspersky Lab products in 213 countries take part in the global information exchange on malicious activity.",https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2013/36660/
