0,APT1,"Hidden Lynx and MSS protection EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: On Tuesday September 17, 2013, Symantec’s Security Response organization published a whitepaper report on Hidden Lynx, a Chinese APT group of professional hackers with advanced capabilities. Evidence suggests that Hidden Lynx is a Chinese state sponsored hacker group with affiliations to “Operation Aurora”. This group was responsible for the compromise of security firm Bit9’s digital code-signing certificate, used to sign 32 pieces of malware. They have been involved in a number of operations over the last four years. The group offers a “hackers for hire” operation that is tasked with retrieving information from a wide range of corporate and government targets. They are a highly efficient team who can undertake multiple campaigns at once, breach some of the world’s best-protected organizations, and can quickly change their tactics to achieve their goal. They usually attack using multiple customized Trojans designed for specific purposes. Backdoor.Moudoor is used for larger campaigns and has seen widespread distribution, while Trojan.Naid is reserved for special operations against high value targets. The group uses cutting-edge attack techniques which makes this team stand out from other major attack groups. Symantec has been actively tracking this group since as early as 2009. THREAT DETAILS: The Hidden Lynx group has been in operation since at least 2009 and appears to be a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” type service. They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently running campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on these factors, the Hidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals. The members of this group are experts at breaching systems. Their method for exploitation and pay-to-order targeted attacks involve a two-pronged strategy using two Trojans designed for each purpose: Team Moudoor distributes Backdoor.Moudoor, a customized version of “Gh0st RAT”, for large-scale campaigns across several industries. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks. Team Naid distributes Trojan.Naid, the Trojan found during the Bit9 incident, which appears to be reserved for more limited attacks against high value targets. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during the VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. This Trojan was also found as part of “Operation Aurora” in 2009. Much of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from China. The group makes use of regular zero-day exploits. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The Hidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is breaking into some of the best-protected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their belt in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks. TARGETS Since November 2011, hundreds of organizations worldwide have been targeted by the Hidden Lynx group. MOTIVATION This broad range of targeted information would indicate that the attackers are part of a professional organization. They are likely tasked with obtaining very specific information that could be used to gain competitive advantages at both a corporate and nation state level. Corporate Espionage The financial services sector has been identified as the most heavily targeted industry overall. There is a tendency to target specific companies within this sector. Investment banks and asset management agencies account for the majority of organizations targeted within this industry. Attacks against Government Contractors In attacks that have targeted all levels of government from local to national level, this group has repeatedly attempted to infiltrate these networks. Attacks against government contractors and, more specifically, the defense industry indicate that the group is in pursuit of confidential information and suggests that the group had been working for nation states. WHAT ARE THEY CAPABLE OF? The Hidden Lynx group’s advanced capabilities are clearly demonstrated in three major campaigns. In the VOHO campaign, they showed how they could subvert Bit9’s established trust models. In the FINSHO campaign, they managed to get advanced knowledge of a zero-day exploit and in the SCADEF operation, they undertook supply chain attacks to succeed in their campaign. IMPACT: Despite the exposure of the Hidden Lynx Chinese APT Hacker group, Symantec believes they will continue their activities. Symantec will continue to monitor activities and provide protection against these attacks. We advise customers to use the latest Symantec technologies and incorporate layered defenses to best protect against attacks by groups like Hidden Lynx.

1,APT1,"Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here at Symantec Security Response, we’ve been keeping our eyes on a group that we believe are among the best of breed. We’ve given them the name of Hidden Lynx—after a string that was found in the command and control server communications. This group has a hunger and drive that surpass other well-known groups such as APT1/Comment Crew. Key characteristics of this group are: technical prowess agility organized sheer resourcefulness patience These attributes are shown by the relentless campaigns waged against multiple concurrent targets over a sustained period of time. They are the pioneers of the “watering hole” technique used to ambush targets, they have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities, and they have the tenacity and patience of an intelligent hunter to compromise the supply chain to get at the true target. These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. They steal on demand, whatever their clients are interested in, hence the wide variety and range of targets. We also believe that to carry out attacks of this scale, the group must have considerable hacking expertise at its disposal, perhaps 50 to 100 operatives are employed and organized into at least two distinct teams both tasked with carrying out different activities using different tools and techniques. These types of attacks require time and effort to carry out, some of the campaigns require research and intelligence gathering before any successful attacks can be mounted. At the front line of this group is a team that uses disposable tools along with basic but effective techniques to attack many different targets. They may also act as intelligence collectors too. This team we call Team Moudoor after the name of the Trojan that they use. Moudoor is a back door Trojan that the team uses liberally without worry about discovery by security firms. The other team acts like a special operations unit, elite personnel used to crack the most valuable or toughest targets. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and are therefore referred to as Team Naid. Unlike Moudoor, the Naid Trojan is used sparingly and with care to avoid detection and capture, like a secret weapon that is only used when failure is not an option. Since 2011, we have observed at least six significant campaigns by this group. The most notable of these campaigns is the VOHO attack campaign of June, 2012. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure. The VOHO campaign was ultimately targeting US defense contractors whose systems were protected by Bit9’s trust-based protection software but when the Hidden Lynx attackers’ progress was blocked by this obstacle, they reconsidered their options and found that the best way around the protection was to compromise the heart of the protection system itself and subvert it for their own purpose. This is exactly what they did when they diverted their attention to Bit9 and breached their systems. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing infrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this system to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to compromise the true intended targets. For those interested in more in-depth information, we have published a whitepaper that describes the group and the attack campaigns carried out by them. We have also put together an infographic that summarizes the key information about this prolific Hidden Lynx group.",https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hidden-lynx-professional-hackers-hire
2,APT1,"Malicious Mandiant Report in Circulation The report, APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units, published by Mandiant earlier this week has drawn worldwide attention by both the security world and the general public. This interest is due to the conclusion the report has drawn regarding the origin of targeted attacks, using advanced persistent threats (APT), performed by a certain group of attackers dubbed the Comment Crew. You can read Symantec’s response to the report here. Today, Symantec has discovered someone performing targeted attacks is using the report as bait in an attempt to infect those who might be interested in reading it. The email we have come across is in Japanese, but this does not mean there are no emails in other languages spreading in the wild. The email purports to be from someone in the media recommending the report. As you can see in Figure 1, the attachment is made to appear like the actual report with the use of a PDF file and the name of the company as the file name. However, like in many targeted attacks, the email is sent from a free email account and the content of the email uses subpar language. It is obvious to a typical Japanese person reading the email that it was not written by a native speaker. When the fake report, which Symantec detects as Trojan.Pidief, is opened, a blank PDF is shown but in the background exploit code for Adobe Acrobat and Reader Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2013-0641) is executed. The PDF file may drop Trojan.Swaylib and Trojan.Dropper, which drops Downloader, if the vulnerbility is successfully exploited. Could the Comment Crew be playing a prank in response to the publication? The truth is we don’t know. Similar tactics have been used in the past, one of which actually involved Symantec. Back in 2011, when we released a whitepaper on another group performing targeted attacks, the attackers took the opportunity to use the publication to infect those interested in reading the paper. They did this by spamming targets with the actual whitepaper along with malware hidden in an archive attachment. If you want to read the actual Mandiant report, or any other for that matter, we advise you to download it directly from the company’s website. The Mandiant download page also provides the hash of the file so that viewers can confirm its authenticity. It is also a good idea to check the hash if you are unsure where you acquired the file from. Update - February, 2013 Initially, this blog stated that the PDF file didn't drop any additional malware. However, after further analysis, it has been found to drop malware in some environments. The blog has been updated to reflect this finding. We have also confirmed that there are multiple variants of the malicious fake report.",https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/malicious-mandiant-report-circulation
3,APT1,"APT1: Additional Comment Crew Indicators of Compromise Mandiant recently released a document containing indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to multiple espionage campaigns by a group known as the Comment Crew. Symantec has been actively tracking this group for six years while maintaining our own database of indicators. From our investigations we have collected thousands of indicators related to Comment Crew. To help increase public awareness, we have decided to release hundreds of additional Comment Crew indicators to those already released. These are indicators that have been seen within the past year. Symantec products already protect against the artifacts related to these indicators and many of these artifacts have already been shared with the security community. You can find these indicators in the following paper: Comment Crew Indicators of Compromise and on Pastebin. Update [February 25, 2013] – Paper now also includes list of associated MD5 hashes.",https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/apt1-additional-comment-crew-indicators-compromise
4,APT1,"APT1: Q&A on Attacks by the Comment Crew Today Mandiant released a detailed report dubbed ""APT1"" which focuses on a prolific cyber espionage campaign by the Comment Crew going back to at least 2006 and targeting a broad range of industries. The report cites the earliest known public reference about APT1 infrastructure as originating from Symantec. We have detected this threat as Backdoor.Wualess since 2006 and have been actively tracking the group behind these attacks. The following Q&A briefly outlines some of the relevant Symantec information around this group: Q: Do Symantec and Norton products protect against threats used by this group? Yes. Symantec confirms protection for attacks associated with the Comment Crew through our antivirus and IPS signatures, as well as STAR malware protection technologies such as our reputation and behavior-based technologies. Symantec.cloud and Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange also detect the targeted emails used by this group. Q: Has Symantec been aware of the activities of the Comment Crew? Yes. Symantec has been actively tracking the work of the Comment Crew for a period of time to ensure that the best possible protection is in place for the different threats used by this group. Q: Why are they called the Comment Crew? They were dubbed the Comment Crew due to their use of HTML comments to hide communication to the command-and-control servers. Q: How does a victim get infected? The initial compromise occurs through a spear phishing email sent to the target. The email contains an attachment using a theme relevant to the target. Some recent examples used by this group and blocked by Symantec technologies are listed here: U.S. Stocks Reverse Loss as Consumer Staples, Energy Gain.zip Instruction_of_KC-135_share_space.doc New contact sheet of the AN-UYQ-100 contractors.pdf U.S. Department of Commerce Preliminarily Determines Chinese and Vietnamese Illegally Dumped Wind Towers in the United States.doc ArmyPlansConferenceOnNewGCVSolicitation.pdf Chinese Oil Executive Learning From Experience.doc My Eight-year In Bank Of America.pdf Similar to what Symantec indicated in a recent blog, if the malicious attachment is opened, it attempts to use an exploit against the target victim's system. It drops the malicious payload as well as a clean document to keep the ruse going. Q: Does Symantec know who this group is targeting? Yes. Symantec telemetry has identified many different industries being targeted by this group including Finance, Information Technology, Aerospace, Energy, Telecommunications, Manufacturing, Transportation, Media, and Public Services. The following Figure shows a worldwide heatmap for detections related to this group since the beginning of 2012. Q: Currently, what are the most prevalent threats being used by this group? Symantec, in the last year, has identified the most prevalent threats being used by this group as Trojan.Ecltys, Backdoor.Barkiofork, and Trojan.Downbot. Q: Has Symantec released any publications around these attacks? Yes. We have recently released publications to address techniques and targets of Trojan.Ecltys and Backdoor.Barkiofork, both of which are threats used by this group: Targeted Attacks Make WinHelp Files Not So Helpful Backdoor.Barkiofork Targets Aerospace and Defense Industry We have also investigated associated attacks of this group: The Truth Behind the Shady RAT Q: What are the Symantec detection family names for threats used by this group? Trojan.Ecltys Backdoor.Barkiofork Backdoor.Wakeminap Trojan.Downbot Backdoor.Dalbot Backdoor.Revird Trojan.Badname Backdoor.Wualess Symantec also detects numerous other files used by this group under various detection names: Trojan Horse Downloader Trojan.ADH Trojan.ADH.2 Trojan.Gen Trojan.Gen.2 Hacktool.Mimikatz Spyware.ADH Q: Does Symantec have IPS protection for these threat families? Yes. There are several IPS signatures to catch threat families associated with this group: System Infected: Trojan.Ecltys Activity 2 System Infected: Barkiofork Malware Activity System Infected: Shady Trojan Activity System Infected: Dalbot Backdoor Activity Q: How will this report affect the Comment Crew operations? Despite the exposure of the Comment Crew, Symantec believes they will continue their activities. We will continue to monitor activities and provide protection against these attacks. We advise customers to use the latest Symantec technologies and incorporate layered defenses to best protect against attacks by groups like the Comment Crew.",https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/apt1-qa-attacks-comment-crew
