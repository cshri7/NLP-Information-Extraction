0,APT10,"China-linked APT10 Hackers Update Attack Techniques

Recently attacks launched by the China-linked threat actor APT10 against the Japanese media sector revealed the use of updated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), FireEye says. 
Also known as menuPass and Stone Panda, which FireEye has been tracking since 2009, the group has a history of targeting Japanese entities. Last year, the group targeted entities in at least fourteen countries, including the website of a prominent U.S. trade association.
As part of the new attacks, spear-phishing emails carrying malicious Word documents that attempt to deliver the UPPERCUT backdoor. Known in the security community as ANEL, the malware was apparently in pre-release form (beta or release candidate) until recently, FireEye’s security researchers say. 
The documents carry a malicious VBA macro and use Japanese titles related to maritime, diplomatic, and North Korean issues (but have unreadable contents). The documents were password protected, with the password provided in the email body. 
Recent UPPERCUT samples have the timestamps overwritten and filled with zeroes and the security researchers do not have visibility into the UPPERCUT 5.2.x series, but say that minor versions might have been released every few months between December 2017 and May 2018.
The latest version also features randomized exported function names and was observed sending an error code in the Cookie header when failing to receive the HTTP response from the command and control (C&C) server. For each C&C address, the malware now has uniquely hard-coded keys it uses for encryption. 
Furthermore, in the generated network traffic, the encoded proxy information has been added in the URL query values during the C&C communication, FireEye said. 
The commands supported in the new version include: download and validate file; upload file to the C&C; load PE file; download, validate, execute file, and send output to C&C server; format the current timestamp; capture the desktop screenshot in PNG format and send it to C&C; execute received buffer via cmd.exe and send the output to the server. 
“While APT10 consistently targets the same geolocation and industry, the malware they use is actively evolving. In the newer versions of UPPERCUT, there is a significant change in the way backdoor initializes the Blowfish encryption key, which makes it harder for analysts to detect and decrypt the backdoor’s network communications. This shows that APT10 is very capable of maintaining and updating their malware,” FireEye concludes.

1,APT10,"China-Linked Group Uses New Malware in Japan Attacks

A China-linked threat actor has been using a new Trojan in attacks aimed at individuals and organizations located in or with ties to Japan, Palo Alto Networks reported on Thursday.
The group is known as menuPass, Stone Panda and APT10, and it has been active since at least 2009. The actor initially targeted defense contractors in the United States and elsewhere, and since 2014 it has also attacked organizations in Japan.
menuPass is known for using PlugX and PoisonIvy, which have been observed in campaigns launched by several actors. However, a recent menuPass operation, which took place between September and November 2016, involved a new Trojan, dubbed ChChes, that is unique to this group.
The recent operation targeted Japanese academics working in various scientific fields, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and a US-based subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturing firm. The attacks started with spear-phishing emails that came from spoofed addresses, including of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the White House.
One clue that linked ChChes to other tools used by menuPass was a shared import hash. However, experts also discovered connections in the infrastructure used in the recent and older attacks.
ChChes was disguised as a Word document and it was signed using a certificate from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. The certificate was leaked when the company was hacked in July 2015, but it had been revoked long before the latest menuPass attacks. Researchers believe attackers may have used it in an effort to make attribution more difficult.
In addition to collecting information about the infected system, ChChes has modules that help it encrypt communications, execute shell commands, upload and download files, and load and execute DLLs, according to an analysis conducted by Japan’s Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC).
Palo Alto Networks believes ChChes is only used to download other malware onto infected computers, especially since it does not have a persistence mechanism.
“In a successful intrusion, it may be only a first stage tool used by the attackers to orient where they landed in a network, and other malware will be deployed as a second stage layering for persistence and additional access as the attackers move laterally through a network,” researchers said in a blog post.

2,APT10,"Operation Cloud Hopper: China-based Hackers Target Managed Service Providers

Operation Cloud Hopper Targets Managed IT Service Providers and Their Clients
A widespread campaign known to be targeting managed service providers (MSPs) in at least fourteen countries has been tied to the group known as APT10 and is thought to be operating out of China. These are the conclusions of a new report published this week by PwC UK and BAE Systems. 
As always with such reports, attribution is down to the weight of circumstantial evidence. The authors detail historical evidence that leads towards APT10, and domain registration timing evidence that suggests operation from within China's timezone. The authors do not suggest that APT10 is state-controlled, but they paint a picture that invites a conclusion that it is at least state-sponsored.
Part of the historical evidence includes an overlap in malware used in attacks previously attributed to APT10. The group is believed to have primarily used Poison Ivy before switching to PlugX; and used both for a period of about nine months. From around mid-2016 it started to 're-tool' and is now using PlugX, ChChes, Quasar and RedLeaves.
There are two big takeaways from this report (PDF): the reality that organizations are still not adequately securing their supply chain; and the potential that the US/China and UK/China agreements to curb economic espionage are now defunct.
The authors describe a campaign that uses well-researched spear-phishing to first compromise MSPs. From here they obtain legitimate credentials to access the MSPs' client networks that align to APT10's targeting profile -- which the authors claim aligns with China's current five-year plan (FYP) for economic growth.
Once on the target network, the attacker moves laterally to locate specific data of interest. This is collected and compressed before being moved back to the MSP and finally sent to a server under the attackers' control. This is a classic supply-chain attack, similar in concept to the iconic Target breach. Organizations are generally getting better at their own security but remain slack over the security of their suppliers -- in this case, their MSPs.
""It is fundamental for organizations to come to terms with the fact that raising their own security posture is essential but not sufficient,"" warns Donato Capitella, senior security consultant at MWR InfoSecurity; ""especially if they are then willing to interweave their IT systems with third parties whose security posture is insufficient. Organizations have to mandate higher security standards if they do not want to see all of their security investment undermined by trivial security mistakes on behalf of their partners. At the same time, third parties that can demonstrably step up their security game will become preferred over time and will undoubtedly have a higher chance to win important contacts in the future.?""
The question over whether the US and UK accords with China over economic espionage is now defunct is posed, but not answered by the study. The US and UK are only two of fourteen countries affected, so they are not specifically targeted. It is MSPs in all of those countries that are the targets; and we are not told of any specific client organizations breached. 
The two accords specify 'economic espionage'; political espionage is still acceptable in both directions. It is perfectly possible, if not likely, that MSPs compromised in America and Britain have not been used for economic gain. Without further information from the authors, we simply do not know.
It is likely that the attackers are the group known as APT10, and it is likely that they are based in China -- but unambiguous attribution and motivation is not possible based on this report. ""Overall,"" comments Israel Barak, CISO of Cybereason, ""the notion that China has decreased its efforts since 2015 to conduct economic espionage is preposterous. China is known for using cutouts and sympathetic agents to collect information on their behalf. China, Russia and other nation states frequently outsource wholesale hacking operations to individual groups and companies. In addition to their government services, these companies contract with, and provide services to, other clients. To do otherwise would greatly devalue the plausible deniability that is one of the major benefits of outsourcing. There are many reasons there is an uptick in outsourcing of operations because countries can rapidly expand capabilities in a short period of time, increase plausible deniability of actions, mitigate risk of detection, gain technical expertise that they cannot recruit directly into the government and decrease overall operational costs.""
But whether this indicates the end of the two China accords is a different matter. ""The most significant challenge for investigators in the UK or US is tying digital activity to a person and organization in this massive breach or any breach for that matter. In reality, we live in a world where as more and more state-sponsored activity is being conducted by corporations, attribution gets even more difficult. To reiterate, it is too early in this particular instance to determine whether the Cameron-Xi accord was broken or is it simply a case of competitive intelligence and cybercrime that must be dealt with bilaterally between Great Britain and China.""",https://www.securityweek.com/operation-cloud-hopper-china-based-hackers-target-managed-service-providers
3,APT10,"Poison Ivy RAT Campaign Leverages New Delivery Techniques

A recently observed campaign using the Poison Ivy remote access tool (RAT) against individuals within the Mongolian government uses publicly available techniques that haven’t been observed in previous campaigns, FireEye reports.
The Poison Ivy backdoor has been around for several years, targeting organizations all around the world, and was associated with a China-linked threat actor known as menuPass, Stone Panda and APT10. The malware packs capabilities such as key logging, screen and video capture, file transfers, password theft, system administration, traffic relaying, and more.
FireEye didn’t attribute the new campaign to a specific actor, and told SecurityWeek in an email that it can’t make direct connections to a particular group at this time. The security firm said it lacks visibility into what the actors did and admitted it doesn’t know if they were successful. Still, the company did say that “espionage is a reasonable assumption for their motives.”
What the newly observed campaign did show, however, was that the actor behind it is up-to-date with recent social engineering and evasion techniques and isn’t shy when it comes to using them. The attacks leveraged an AppLocker bypass that was publicly revealed last year, as well as fileless execution and persistence, and benign documents to minimize user suspicion of malicious activity.
The malware was distributed via Word documents with malicious macros, and the threat actor was using social engineering to trick users into enabling these macros. The malicious documents were delivered via email, claiming to contain instructions for logging into webmail or information regarding a state law proposal, FireEye explains.
The malicious macros in the documents were designed to invoke Regsvr32, a command-line utility designed for registering DLLs in the registry, to download a Windows Script Component file (SCT file) by passing the URL of the SCT file as an argument. This technique was demonstrated last year to effectively bypass AppLocker, the Microsoft application whitelisting solution that prevents unknown executables from running on a system.
In this campaign, the malicious SCT file was designed to invoke WScript to launch PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command, FireEye reports. After the PowerShell command is decoded, another layer of PowerShell instructions emerges, serving two purposes: to download a decoy document from the Internet and open it in a second winword.exe process using the Start-Process cmdlet; and to download and run another PowerShell script named f0921.ps1.
The third stage PowerShell script configures an encoded command persistently as base64 string in the HKCU: \Console\FontSecurity registry key, along with an HKCU\CurrentVersion\Run\SecurityUpdate value to launch the encoded PowerShell payload stored in the previously configured key. Thus, the PowerShell payload is executed every time the user logs in to the system.
A fourth stage PowerShell script in the HKCU\Console\FontSecurity registry borrows from the publicly available Inject-LocalShellCode script from PowerSploit to inject shellcode, researchers explain. The shellcode has a custom XOR-based decryption loop that uses a single byte key (0xD4), and was designed to inject the Poison Ivy backdoor into userinit.exe. The decrypted shellcode also revealed content and configuration related to Poison Ivy.
“Although Poison Ivy has been a proven threat for some time, the delivery mechanism for this backdoor uses recent publicly available techniques that differ from previously observed campaigns. Through the use of PowerShell and publicly available security control bypasses and scripts, most steps in the attack are performed exclusively in memory and leave few forensic artifacts on a compromised host,” FireEye says.

4,APT10,"China-Linked Hackers Target U.S. Trade Group

A threat actor linked to China hijacked the website of a prominent U.S. trade association in an effort to deliver reconnaissance malware to individuals who accessed certain web pages.
Fidelis Cybersecurity published a report detailing the campaign on Thursday, just hours before a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.
The company noticed in late February that the website of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) had been hacked and set up to serve malware in what is known as a watering hole attack, or a strategic web compromise. Experts believe the attack ended by March 2, when links injected into the NFTC website had been removed.
Evidence uncovered by investigators led them to believe that the attack was conducted by a China-linked cyber espionage group known as APT10, MenuPass and Stone Panda. Fidelis has dubbed the campaign Operation TradeSecret.
According to researchers, the hackers set up certain web pages of the NFTC website to serve a reconnaissance framework known as Scanbox. The tool has been used for several years, including in attacks aimed at U.S. organizations and the Uyghur population in China.
Scanbox has various plugins that allow attackers to collect information about the infected system and the software installed on it, and log keystrokes from the web browser. The harvested data can then be used to launch further attacks against the targeted individuals.
In the case of the NFTC, whose board of directors includes some of the largest private sector companies in the United States, APT10 targeted only specific web pages. One of them was a registration page for a board of directors meeting, which suggests that people or organizations expected to attend the meeting had been targeted.
“All organizations that have representatives on the board of directors of the NFTC -- or those who would have a reason to visit the site -- should investigate potentially impacted hosts using indicators provided in this report,” warned Fidelis. “Since the reconnaissance tool is typically used to enable future targeting campaigns, it should be assumed that targeted individuals will be subject to further attacks -- such as spearphishing campaigns.”
The security firm said it notified the lobbying group of the breach. SecurityWeek has reached out to NFTC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds.
Fidelis also reported seeing a similar campaign involving a fake website of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The APT10 attacks targeting Japan were also detailed in a report published this week by PwC UK and BAE Systems.
The research conducted by the two companies focused on attacks launched by APT10 against managed service providers (MSPs) in at least fourteen countries.

5,APT10,"DHS Warns of Attacks on Managed Service Providers

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this week issued an alert on ongoing activity from an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor targeting global managed service providers (MSPs).
The activity, DHS says, involves attempts to infiltrate the networks of global MSPs, which provide remote management of customer IT and end-user systems. 
The use of MSP increases an organization’s virtual enterprise infrastructure footprint, but also creates a large attack surface for cyber criminals and nation-state actors, DHS’ United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) points out.
The newly released alert, TA18-276B, is related to activity that DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) warned about in April 2017. 
The same activity was associated by security firms with a Chinese actor referred to as APT10, but which is also known as menuPass and Stone Panda. The group is believed to be state-sponsored.
Tracked since 2009, the group has historically targeted mainly Japanese entities. Last year, the group was observed targeting entities in at least fourteen countries, including the website of a prominent U.S. trade association.
The threat actor is known for the use of a broad range of malware families, including the PlugX RAT, ChChes, Quasar, RedLeaves, the UPPERCUT backdoor, NetTraveler (aka TravNet), and ZeroT.
“Since May 2016, APT actors have used various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the purposes of cyber espionage and intellectual property theft. APT actors have targeted victims in several U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including Information Technology (IT), Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Communications, and Critical Manufacturing,” DHS’ new alert reads. 
DHS’ new technical alert also includes information on the protective measures organizations should take to mitigate the risks associated with their MSP, which could expose them to APT activity. 
These include restricting access to networks and systems, using a dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN) for MSP connection, using firewalls, implement best practices for password and permission management, and incorporate operational controls.

6,APT10,"Don't Fall Victim to IP Theft and Corporate Espionage

If the infamous bank robber, Willie Sutton, were alive today and honed his cyber skills, he might turn his attention to corporate espionage. Why? Because, as he once said about banks, “that’s where the money is.”
Unlike “traditional cyberespionage” which typically takes place between nation-state actors and is used for political gain or to compromise national security, corporate espionage targets proprietary information from private entities for commercial advantage, although in some cases nation-states will target private entities in industries such as energy given their national importance. Over the past two years, several threat actors have launched corporate espionage campaigns against companies in pharmaceuticals, chemicals and related industries with the aim of profiting from proprietary information such as intellectual property, R&D material on new products and technologies as well as financial information. The actors behind these campaigns are each known by different names, but include “APT10”, “Crouching Yeti”, “FIN4”, “Operation Ghoul”, “Patchwork”, “Poseidon”, “Tick” and “Turla.”
How do these threat groups go about these campaigns? Much like Willie Sutton, a master of disguise who would infiltrate banks and stores impersonating a messenger, postal worker, maintenance man or even a police officer, espionage threat actors use spearphishing, watering holes, and malicious software downloads to disguise the initial infection. Once inside the network, they typically use custom backdoor malware to achieve lateral movement, data exfiltration and persistence. To better understand what’s required to mitigate risk, let’s take a closer look at just a handful of these threat groups and the primary tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) they feature in their campaigns.
The most technically sophisticated use detailed social engineering techniques, zero-day exploits and weaknesses in the supply chain. For example, Tick uses a variety of methods to gain access to victim networks, such as spearphishing, watering hole attacks and software exploitations including a zero-day vulnerability to access company networks. The group has used custom malware, as well as legitimate penetration testing tools to move laterally within a network, escalate privileges, harvest credentials and exfiltrate data. Recently, Tick has adopted a steganography technique, embedding malicious code in an image file downloaded from a compromised website, thus bypassing firewalls and avoiding detection by anti-virus solutions.
Another technically sophisticated group that continues to evolve is APT10. The group first accesses target networks by compromising a service provider within the supply chain through spearphishing techniques, and then moves laterally to gain access to their primary target. More recent campaigns involve custom tools the group has developed that contain “decoy documents” to deliver a variety of payloads that can execute a range of activities including enabling communication with command and control (C2) servers, finding files, exfiltrating data and taking screen shots.
Groups with lesser technical capability tend to rely on commercial malware variants, but should not be discounted. Operation Ghoul is one such example – targeting more than 130 organizations in 18 months, the group is intent on its mission. Operation Ghoul uses spearphishing emails, mostly sent to executives and other senior employees at target organizations. The messages have contained compressed executables with data-harvesting malware, reportedly based on commercial spyware. The malware logs keystrokes and collects passwords, screenshots, account data from browsers and clipboard data and communicates using a single C2 server.
Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (known or unidentified) are often exploited by espionage threat actors as part of their campaigns. Patchwork and Turla are prime examples. Patchwork commonly uses phishing emails and malicious sites to deliver Microsoft Office or PowerPoint files that exploit several known vulnerabilities, including:
● CVE-2012-1856● CVE-2014-4114● CVE-2017-0199● CVE-2017-8570● CVE-2015-1641● CVE-2012-0158
These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely exploit arbitrary code on several Microsoft Windows operating systems, as well as some Microsoft applications, which are used by organizations across industries. Turla also uses vulnerabilities that were not publicly reported at their time of use (zero-day exploits) including CVE-2017-0261, CVE-2017-0262 and CVE-2017-0263. These vulnerabilities in several Microsoft Office versions allow for remote code execution.
Given the TTPs just discussed, the following tips can help organizations mitigate risk of IP theft and corporate espionage and strengthen their security posture:
Spearphishing and watering hole attacks: Provide phishing and general online security training to every employee. Best practices include limiting online activity to reputable sites, avoiding opening unsolicited attachments and performing extra checks before interacting with suspicious email messages.
Malicious software downloads: Individuals should only download applications from legitimate sites. Be sure to review security and access permissions granted to these programs.
Credential harvesting and account takeover: Mandate strong password security across the organization, ensuring passwords are of appropriate length and not reused across accounts. Monitor for exposed credentials on sites like haveibeenpwned.com and use multi-factor authentication for accounts where possible.
Supply chain attacks: Suppliers are often given undue and wholesale access and capabilities to company networks. Organizations should apply technological controls and access restrictions to suppliers, such as separation of duties and least privilege, as well as network isolation and segmentation of the supply chain.
Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Regularly apply patches as they are released and monitor for known security vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.
Defense in depth: Consider a broad security strategy guided by four main principles: use of host-based firewalls and IP-whitelisting measures, segmenting networks and restricting workstation-to-workstation communication, applying patches and disabling unneeded legacy features, and restricting access to important data to only those who are required to have it.
For Willie Sutton, banks were high-value targets and tellers had no choice but to hand over the money. Today, high-value targets for corporate espionage include any organization with proprietary information that can be sold for financial gain. Fortunately, by following these steps organizations don’t have to “hand over the money,” but can proactively mitigate risk of IP theft and corporate espionage.",https://www.securityweek.com/dont-fall-victim-ip-theft-and-corporate-espionage
7,APT10,"Researchers Warn Against Knee-Jerk Attribution of 'Olympic Destroyer' Attack


Attribution has become a buzzword in malware analysis. It is very difficult to achieve -- but is necessary in a world that is effectively engaged in the early stages of a geopolitical cyberwar. Malware researchers tend to stop short of saying, 'this country or that actor is behind this attack'. Nevertheless, they are not shy in dropping hints, leaving the reader to make subjective conclusions.
They have done just that with the recent cyber-attacks against the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
The New York Times comments, ""Security companies would not say definitively who was behind the attack, but some digital crumbs led to a familiar culprit: Fancy Bear, the Russian hacking group with ties to Russian intelligence services.""
Microsoft tweeted, ""Fresh analysis of the #cyberattack against systems used in the Pyeongchang #WinterOlympics reveals #EternalRomance SMB exploit.""
EternalRomance -- one of the leaked NSA exploits -- along with SMB was employed in the Bad Rabbit ransomware which has been likened to NotPetya which the UK government today ascribed to the Russian intelligence services.
Intezer is a firm that specializes in recognizing code reuse. It has analyzed the Olympic attacks, and comments, ""We have found numerous small code fragments scattered throughout different samples of malware in these attacks that are uniquely linked to APT3, APT10, and APT12 which are known to be affiliated with Chinese threat actors.""
Recorded Future comments (PDF), ""Our own research turned up trivial but consistent code similarities between Olympic Destroyer modules and several malware families used by the Lazarus Group. These include standard but different functions within BlueNoroff Banswift malware, the LimaCharlie family of Lazarus malware from the Novetta Blockbuster report, and a module from the Lazarus SpaSpe malware meant to target domain controllers."" Lazarus is, of course, considered to be synonymous with North Korea.
But while saying that there are code similarity hints at connections with North Korea, Recorded Future warns against jumping to any specific conclusion. ""The trouble with this technique is that while code similarity can be stated with certainty, down to a percentage of bytes shared, the results are not straightforward and require expert interpretation. The Olympic Destroyer malware is a perfect example of how we can be led astray by this clustering technique when our standard for similarity is too low.""
Code analysis suggests that Russia, China or North Korea, or any combination thereof, or all, or none of these state actors were behind the Winter Olympics attack.
Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, principal security researcher at the Insikt Group at Recorded Future says: “Complex malware operations make us take pause to reevaluate research methods and make sure the research community is not being misled by its own eagerness to attribute attacks.""
Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future says: “Attribution continues to be important in cyber-attacks because it shapes the victim, public, and government responses. However, accurate attribution is both more crucial and more difficult to determine than ever because adversaries are constantly evolving new techniques and the expertise required to identify a sophisticated actor keeps increasing.”
This doesn't mean that Recorded Future drops no hints of its own. It notes that this was a sophisticated two-pronged attack probably involving an earlier malware attack designed to steal credentials to be used during the opening ceremony against both the organizers and the infrastructure providers. In other words, it could only be achieved by a highly resourced attacker. 
The attack's purpose was disruption rather than absolute destruction. While systems were wiped, they were left able to reboot -- allowing the possibility of eventual data recovery and reinstatement. There is no immediately apparent attempt at extortion -- removing financial motivation and leaving the probability of political motivation.
The 'hints' contained in the code similarity point variously at Russia, China and North Korea. Recorded Future adds another possibility: ""The co-occurrence of code overlap in the malware may be indicative of a false flag operation, attempting to dilute evidence and confuse researchers."" In other words, without access to 5Eyes-quality wiretaps and intercepted voice conversations (which intelligence agencies would be unwilling to reveal) it is all but impossible to attribute this, or any other cyber-attack, with 100% confidence.
As Recorded Future concludes, ""For the time being, attribution remains inconclusive.""

8,APT10,"Report Highlights Business Risks Drawn From Geopolitical Flashpoints


Flashpoint's mid-year Business Risk Intelligence Report analyzes data from geopolitics and the deep and dark web to show how threat actors and their motivations have evolved over the first six months of 2017, and to provide insight into what new threats might appear in the coming months. It comprises sections covering both the primary nation-states and the main threat sub-sections.
Russia
The report notes the continuing Russian effort to interfere with western elections; especially during the approach to the German national elections in September 2017. 
The Shadow Brokers (TSB) have re-emerged from dormancy, and are generally considered to be tied to the Russian state. Internally, Russia is tightening control over dissidents and internet usage. Ruslan Stoyanov was arrested over un-specified charges relating to 'treason'. From prison, he warned the regime against ""the consequences of partnering with domestic 'patriot-thieves' (cybercriminals).
""Moscow is moving quickly towards establishing an unprecedented level of information control within the country's borders"" warns Flashpoint, ""...cementing the state's authority over online activities.""
China
Chinese state-sponsored activity has remained low following the Xi-Obama agreement made in September 2015. Nevertheless, there has been some activity. In early March, a DHS report described activity under the 'Pleasantly Surprised' campaign spear-phishing commercial entities in the financial, retail and technology sectors. APT10 was also linked to a campaign targeting the National Foreign Trade Council around the time of the US/China summit in early April. Other probable Chinese activities included attacks against MSSPs and attempts to compromise South Korea's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system.
Flashpoint notes that China remains a potent cyber force, but seems to have turned the focus of its attention to Asian and geographically nearby targets. Internally it continues to increase control over cyber activities with new regulations on data flows and VPNs.
Five Eyes
The Five Eyes group of nations is described as the ""pinnacle of cyber capabilities of all actors in cyberspace"" -- but one that is not considered a 'threat actor' to other western nations. However, the NSA continues to be embarrassed by the TSB leaks, while the CIA has been embarrassed by WikiLeaks' Vault7 leaks. However, ""Despite the synchronicity between the ShadowBrokers releases and the Wikileaks dump, there is no known connection between the two,"" says Flashpoint.
Iran
Iran is described as a 'moderately-capable threat actor in cyberspace', and one that has concentrated on exploiting vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems. While it has been relatively quiet in recent months, Flashpoint warns that any attempt by the US Administration to dismantle the Iranian nuclear accord is likely ""to be accompanied by renewed Iranian efforts in the cyber domain."" However, for the moment, it believes that the ""re-election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is likely to have a stabilizing effect on Iranian cyber activities.""
North Korea
North Korea is considered to be a potent threat, but one that has been relatively quiet this year following China's apparent withdrawal of political support. Nevertheless, there have been at least two spear-phishing campaigns: one against South Korean research organizations, and the other against North Korean defectors.
The report notes the suggested links of the WannaCry ransomware to the North Korean Lazarus Group. Its own findings suggest a Chinese-speaking author; but adds these two findings are not mutually exclusive.
Geopolitically, the Trump administration has said, the ""era of strategic patience is over."" Flashpoint concludes, ""The North's current apparent quiescence in cyberspace may come to a swift end in the event that the United States reacts strongly to the country's sixth nuclear test, for which many analysts believe that Pyongyang is preparing.""
Just this week, US-CERT released a technical alert on behalf of the DHS and the FBI to warn organizations of North Korea’s “Hidden Cobra” activities, particularly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Disruptive and Attention-Seeking Actors
Such actors have been quieter than usual during the first half of 2017. Flashpoint believes it may be because they are starved of publicity due to the media's current focus on the new administration and the FBI/Russia probe. Other reasons may be industry's improving security stance and, for example, the increased awareness among police departments of SWATTING techniques.
Cybercriminals
Cybercriminals are continuing to innovate and evolve. The switch from targeting individuals to targeting organizations continues, and the focus on targeting healthcare remains. ""Flashpoint has observed a variety of actors such as ""svako,"" ""hackworld,"" ""covrig3500,"" and more targeting healthcare clinics across the United States in efforts to monetize the stolen data.""
Business Email Compromise (BEC) is growing. In April, Google and Facebook became victims in a scam that netted $100 million for the scammers.
Hacktivists
Flashpoint notes a decline in western hacktivism. ""Thus far in 2017,"" it says, ""the hacktivist landscape has been dominated by a small subset of largely-ineffectual hacktivist operations linked to the Anonymous collective, as well as activity emanating out of Turkey and China in particular."" 
Jihadi Actors
Jihadi actors have shown little growth in technical skill over the first half of 2017. ""Due to the lack of technical acumen within most jihadi hacker groups, their victims tend to be poorly-defended or smaller, low-hanging-fruit websites."" The most active hacker group is the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) which has called for all pro-ISIS hackers to unite under one banner, including the newly-created ""Caliphate Cyber Terrorism Army (CCTA)."" There is, however, no evidence that the group is directed or supported by ISIS itself.
