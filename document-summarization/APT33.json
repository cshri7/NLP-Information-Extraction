[{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT33","text":"When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group that previously used SHAMOON \u2013 aka Disttrack \u2013 to target organizations in the Persian Gulf. However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.  Recent investigations by FireEye\u2019s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of APT33\u2019s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations. This blog highlights some of our analysis. Our detailed report on FireEye MySIGHT contains a more thorough review of our supporting evidence and analysis. We will also be discussing this threat group further during our webinar on Sept. 21 at 8 a.m. ET.  Targeting  APT33 has targeted organizations \u2013 spanning multiple industries \u2013 headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.  From mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings.  During the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared to target a Saudi organization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.  We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia\u2019s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran\u2019s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran\u2019s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia.  We believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea\u2019s recent partnerships with Iran\u2019s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea\u2019s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies. Iran has expressed interest in\u00a0growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies. APT33 may have targeted these organizations as a result of Iran\u2019s desire to expand its own petrochemical production and improve its competitiveness within the region.  The generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups, indicating a common interest in the sectors across Iranian actors.  Figure 1 shows the global scope of APT33 targeting.   Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting  Spear Phishing  APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. These emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious HTML application (.hta) files. The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals.  An example .hta file excerpt is provided in Figure 2. To the user, the file would appear as benign references to legitimate job postings; however, unbeknownst to the user, the .hta file also contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor.   Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file  We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016. Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate \u2013 they referenced a specific job opportunity and salary, provided a link to the spoofed company\u2019s employment website, and even included the spoofed company\u2019s Equal Opportunity hiring statement. However, in a few cases, APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell\u2019s phishing module. These appear to be mistakes, as minutes after sending the emails with the default values, APT33 sent emails to the same recipients with the default values removed.  As shown in Figure 3, the \u201cfake mail\u201d phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[.]com), subject line (\u201cyour site hacked by me\u201d), and email body (\u201cHi Dear Admin\u201d).   Figure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)  Figure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell.   Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values  Domain Masquerading  APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi\u2019s military and commercial fleet. Based on observed targeting patterns, APT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations.  The following domains masquerade as these organizations: Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), and Vinnell Arabia.   boeing.servehttp[.]com   alsalam.ddns[.]net   ngaaksa.ddns[.]net   ngaaksa.sytes[.]net   vinnellarabia.myftp[.]org    Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft company, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries entered into a joint venture to create the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Center in Saudi Arabia in 2015 with the goal of servicing Saudi Arabia\u2019s rotorcraft fleet and building a self-sustaining workforce in the Saudi aerospace supply base.  Alsalam Aircraft Company also offers military and commercial maintenance, technical support, and interior design and refurbishment services.  Two of the domains appeared to mimic Northrop Grumman joint ventures. These joint ventures \u2013 Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia \u2013 provide aviation support in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia. Both Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia have been involved in contracts to train Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of National Guard.  Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government  We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries.  We assess an actor using the handle \u201cxman_1365_x\u201d may have been involved in the development and potential use of APT33\u2019s TURNEDUP backdoor due to the inclusion of the handle in the processing-debugging (PDB) paths of many of TURNEDUP samples. An example can be seen in Figure 5.   Figure 5: \u201cxman_1365_x\" PDB String in TURNEDUP Sample  Xman_1365_x was also a community manager in the Barnamenevis Iranian programming and software engineering forum, and registered accounts in the well-known Iranian Shabgard and Ashiyane forums, though we did not find evidence to suggest that this actor was ever a formal member of the Shabgard or Ashiyane hacktivist groups.  Open source reporting links the \u201cxman_1365_x\u201d actor to the \u201cNasr Institute,\u201d which is purported to be equivalent to Iran\u2019s \u201ccyber army\u201d and controlled by the Iranian government. Separately, additional evidence ties the \u201cNasr Institute\u201d to the 2011-2013 attacks on the financial industry, a series of denial of service attacks dubbed Operation Ababil. In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that named two individuals allegedly hired by the Iranian government to build attack infrastructure and conduct distributed denial of service attacks in support of Operation Ababil. While the individuals and the activity described in indictment are different than what is discussed in this report, it provides some evidence that individuals associated with the \u201cNasr Institute\u201d may have ties to the Iranian government.  Potential Ties to Destructive Capabilities and Comparisons with SHAMOON  One of the droppers used by APT33, which we refer to as DROPSHOT, has been linked to the wiper malware SHAPESHIFT. Open source research indicates SHAPESHIFT may have been used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia.  Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT. The SHAPESHIFT malware is capable of wiping disks, erasing volumes and deleting files, depending on its configuration. Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain Farsi language artifacts, which indicates they may have been developed by a Farsi language speaker (Farsi is the predominant and official language of Iran).  While we have not directly observed APT33 use SHAPESHIFT or otherwise carry out destructive operations, APT33 is the only group that we have observed use the DROPSHOT dropper. It is possible that DROPSHOT may be shared amongst Iran-based threat groups, but we do not have any evidence that this is the case.  In March 2017, Kasperksy released a report that compared DROPSHOT (which they call Stonedrill) with the most recent variant of SHAMOON (referred to as Shamoon 2.0). They stated that both wipers employ anti-emulation techniques and were used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia, but also mentioned several differences. For example, they stated DROPSHOT uses more advanced anti-emulation techniques, utilizes external scripts for self-deletion, and uses memory injection versus external drivers for deployment. Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources.  We have also observed differences in both targeting and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the group using SHAMOON and APT33. For example, we have observed SHAMOON being used to target government organizations in the Middle East, whereas APT33 has targeted several commercial organizations both in the Middle East and globally. APT33 has also utilized a wide range of custom and publicly available tools during their operations. In contrast, we have not observed the full lifecycle of operations associated with SHAMOON, in part due to the wiper removing artifacts of the earlier stages of the attack lifecycle.  Regardless of whether DROPSHOT is exclusive to APT33, both the malware and the threat activity appear to be distinct from the group using SHAMOON. Therefore, we assess there may be multiple Iran-based threat groups capable of carrying out destructive operations.  Additional Ties Bolster Attribution to Iran  APT33\u2019s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests, implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored. This coupled with the timing of operations \u2013 which coincides with Iranian working hours \u2013 and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government.  The times of day that APT33 threat actors were active suggests that they were operating in a time zone close to 04:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time of the observed attacker activity coincides with Iran\u2019s Daylight Time , which is +0430 UTC.  APT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran\u2019s workweek, Saturday to Wednesday. This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday, as shown in Figure 6. Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday work week, with government offices closed on Thursday and some private businesses operating on a half day schedule on Thursday.  Many other Middle East countries have elected to have a Friday and Saturday weekend.  Iran is one of few countries that subscribes to a Saturday to Wednesday workweek.  APT33 leverages popular Iranian hacker tools and DNS servers used by other suspected Iranian threat groups. The publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by APT33 \u2013 including NANOCORE, NETWIRE, and ALFA Shell \u2013 are all available on Iranian hacking websites, associated with Iranian hackers, and used by other suspected Iranian threat groups. While not conclusive by itself, the use of publicly available Iranian hacking tools and popular Iranian hosting companies may be a result of APT33\u2019s familiarity with them and lends support to the assessment that APT33 may be based in Iran.   Figure 6: APT33 Interactive Commands by Day of Week  Outlook and Implications  Based on observed targeting, we believe APT33 engages in strategic espionage by targeting geographically diverse organizations across multiple industries. Specifically, the targeting of organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the threat group is likely in search of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor. APT33\u2019s focus on aviation may indicate the group\u2019s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran\u2019s aviation capabilities or to support Iran\u2019s military and strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production. We expect APT33 activity will continue to cover a broad scope of targeted entities, and may spread into other regions and sectors as Iranian interests dictate.  APT33\u2019s use of multiple custom backdoors suggests that they have access to some of their own development resources, with which they can support their operations, while also making use of publicly available tools. The ties to SHAPESHIFT may suggest that APT33 engages in destructive operations or that they share tools or a developer with another Iran-based threat group that conducts destructive operations.

DROPSHOT was previously analyzed by Kaspersky, which tracks it as StoneDrill.\nThe StoneDrill malware was tied by Kaspersky to the notorious Shamoon 2 and Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef), a threat actor believed to be operating out of Iran.\nFireEye has also linked APT33 to Iran based on connections to the \u201cNasr Institute,\u201d which is said to be Iran\u2019s \u201ccyber army\u201d, attacks launched during Iranian working hours, and the use of Iranian hacking tools.\nIran appears to have several cyber espionage groups, including Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten and CopyKittens.\nRelated: Iranian Hackers Exploit Recent Office 0-Day in Attacks\nRelated: Iranian Cyberspy Groups Share Malware Code\nRelated: Iran-Linked Hackers Use \"Mia Ash\" Honey Trap to Compromise Targets","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/iranian-hackers-target-aerospace-energy-companies"},{"Unnamed: 0":1,"query":"APT33","text":"Five Threat Groups Target Industrial Systems: Dragos\r\n\nThere are at least five sophisticated threat groups whose activities focus on industrial control systems (ICS), according to a report published on Thursday by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos.\nWhile it\u2019s not uncommon for non-targeted malware to make its way onto industrial systems, targeted attacks have also become increasingly common. Dragos currently tracks five threat actors that have either attacked ICS directly or have shown an interest in gathering information on these types of systems.\nOne of these groups is tracked by the security firm as Electrum. This is the actor behind the CRASHOVERRIDE\/Industroyer malware used in December 2016 to cause a power outage in Ukraine. Electrum has been linked to Sandworm Team, which is believed to be responsible for a 2015 power outage in Ukraine. Russia has been accused for both attacks.\nWhile it apparently hasn\u2019t launched any major attacks since the 2016 campaign targeting Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, Dragos says Electrum continues to be active, and evidence suggests it has expanded targets.\n\u201cWhile past ELECTRUM activity has focused exclusively on Ukraine, information from low- level ongoing events and the group\u2019s link to SANDWORM Dragos assesses that ELECTRUM could be \u2018re-tasked\u2019 to other areas depending on the focus of their sponsor,\u201d Dragos said in its report.\nAnother gang tracked by Dragos is Covellite, which has been linked to North Korea\u2019s Lazarus group. Researchers started observing Covellite in September 2017, when it launched a highly targeted phishing campaign against a U.S. electric grid company. They later spotted attacks that may have been conducted by this group aimed at organizations in Europe, North America and East Asia.\nUnlike Electrum, Covellite has yet to use malware specifically designed to target industrial systems in its campaigns.\nDragos\u2019 report also summarizes the activities of Dymalloy, a group whose attacks came to light during an investigation into Dragonfly, an actor that is also known as Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear. Dragonfly, which is believed to be operating out of Russia, is known for its sophisticated Havex malware, and it was recently observed targeting control systems in U.S. energy firms.\nDragos believes Dymalloy is not linked \u2013 at least not directly \u2013 to Dragonfly and its tools are not as advanced as Havex. However, the hackers did manage to breach ICS organizations in Turkey, Europe and North America, gaining access to HMI devices.\nExperts say Dymalloy appears to have become less active since early 2017, possibly in response to attention from the media and security researchers.\nLearn More at SecurityWeek\u2019s ICS Cyber Security Conference\nSince mid-2017, Dragos has been tracking a group it has named Chrysene, whose activity focuses on North America, Western Europe, Israel and Iraq, particularly organizations in the electricity generation and oil&gas sectors.\nChrysene, which continues to be active, has used a unique variation of a framework associated with the Iran-linked cyber espionage groups known as OilRig and Greenbug.\n\u201cWhile CHRYSENE\u2019s malware features notable enhancements over related threat groups using similar tools, Dragos has not yet observed an ICS-specific capability employed by this activity group. Instead, all activity thus far appears to focus on IT penetration and espionage, with all targets being ICS-related organizations,\u201d Dragos said.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the recently uncovered piece of malware known as Trisis\/Triton, which is the first threat specifically designed to disrupt safety instrumented systems (SIS), has also been linked by some researchers to Iran.\nThe last ICS-focused threat group monitored by Dragos is Magnallium, which has also been linked to Iran. The security firm started tracking this actor following a report from FireEye on the activities of APT33.\nWhile some media reports portrayed APT33 as a serious threat to ICS and critical infrastructure, Dragos\u2019 investigation showed that the group does not appear to possess any ICS-specific capabilities.\n\u201cWhile only one [of these groups] has demonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware directly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the ICS environment,\u201d Dragos said.\n\u201cThese groups have remained relatively constant regarding overall activity throughout the year, and Dragos is confident that additional unknown events have occurred,\u201d the company added.\nRelated: DHS Warns of Malware Targeting Industrial Safety Systems\nRelated: DDoS Attacks More Likely to Hit Critical Infrastructure Than APTs","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/five-threat-groups-target-industrial-systems-dragos"},{"Unnamed: 0":2,"query":"APT33","text":"Iranian Hackers Impersonate Israeli Security Firm\r\n\nA group of Iranian hackers focused on cyber-espionage recently built up a website to impersonate ClearSky Cyber Security, the Israeli firm that exposed their activities not long ago.\nThe hackers, tracked as APT35 and also known as NewsBeef, Newscaster, and Charming Kitten, have been active since at least 2011, with their activities detailed for the first time several years ago.\nIn December 2017, ClearSky Cyber Security published a report detailing the group\u2019s activities during the 2016-2017 timeframe. The security firm not only described the actor\u2019s infrastructure, but also provided information on DownPaper, a new piece of malware the hackers had been using.\nThe security firm exposed the link between the group and Behzad Mesri, also known as Skote Vahshat, who was charged in November 2017 with the hacking of HBO. Furthermore, the researchers also managed to establish the identity of two other alleged members of the group.\nRoughly half a year after the report was published, the security firm announced on its Twitter account that the hackers built their own site impersonating ClearSky.\n\u201c#CharmingKitten built a phishing website impersonating our company. The fake website is clearskysecurity\\.net (the real website is http:\/\/clearskysec.com),\u201d the security firm announced.\nThe advanced persistent threat (APT) apparently copied entire pages from the legitimate website, but also changed one of them to include a sign in option with multiple services. Anyone entering credentials there would have had them sent to the actor instead.\n\u00a0\u201cThese sign in options are all phishing pages that would send the victim's credentials to the attackers. Our legitimate website does not have any sign in option. It seems that the impersonating website is still being built because some of the pages have error messages in them,\u201d the security firm announced.\nOne of the pages on the fake website, the security researchers discovered, featured content related to a Charming Kitten campaign that ClearSky exposed only several weeks ago. That page, however, wasn\u2019t customized to look like the security firm\u2019s website.\nThe fake website started being flagged as deceptive soon after ClearSky discovered it. The security firm says that its employees, services, and customers were not affected.\nOver the past years, security researchers managed to link various hacking groups to Iran, including APT33, Rocket Kitten, Magic Hound, and CopyKittens, and even revealed that they tend to share infrastructure and malware code.\nRelated: HBO Hacker Linked to Iranian Spy Group\nRelated: Iranian Cyberspies Use New Trojan in Middle East Attacks","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/iranian-hackers-impersonate-israeli-security-firm"},{"Unnamed: 0":3,"query":"APT33","text":"Industry Reactions to Iran Cyber Retaliation Over U.S. Nuclear Deal Exit\r\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced this week that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on the Middle Eastern country.
