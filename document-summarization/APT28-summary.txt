APT28 Uses Malicious Document to Target Hospitality Industry  FireEye has uncovered a malicious document sent in spear phishing emails to multiple companies in the hospitality industry, including hotels in at least seven European countries and one Middle Eastern country in early July. Once inside the network of a hospitality company, APT28 sought out machines that controlled both guest and internal Wi-Fi networks. To spread through the hospitality companys network, APT28 used a version of the EternalBlue SMB exploit. South Korea-nexus Fallout Team (aka Darkhotel) has used spoofed software updates on infected Wi-Fi networks in Asian hotels , and Duqu 2.0 malware has been found on the networks of European hotels used by participants in the Iranian nuclear negotiations. APT28s already wide-ranging capabilities and tactics are continuing to grow and refine as the group expands its infection vectors.

While APT28s malware is fairly well known in the cybersecurity community, our report details additional information exposing ongoing, focused operations that we believe indicate a government sponsor based in Moscow. In contrast with the China-based threat actors that FireEye tracks, APT28 does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain. Instead, APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. As with the APT1 report, we recognize that no single entity completely understands the entire complex picture of intense cyber espionage over many years.

This turned out to be a new zero-day vulnerability for Internet Explorer (CVE-2018-8174) patched by Microsoft on May 8, 2018. Researchers in the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab analyzed the EXIF processing mechanism . We think they did this by inserting malicious scripts into the countrys official websites in order to conduct watering-hole attacks. Its possible that the attackers used a watering hole to infect data center employees. We suspect that this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to process the malwares HTTP requests. We have continued to track this APT groups activities and recently noticed that they have started a new campaign with a different geographical distribution and using new themes. The group continues to use a non-executable infection vector and highly obfuscated scripts to evade detection. We also saw infections in China, India and Bangladesh. As a result, they are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacksintruders can intercept transmitted data by persuading victims to install their certificate. Partner organizations often arrange ticket giveaways for clients, and attackers exploit this to lure their victims onto fake promotion sites.

Throughout these waves, we observed that the targets provided connection, even tangential, to Ukraine and NATO military and diplomatic interests. Sofacy selectively used SPLM/CHOPSTICK modules as second stage implants to high interest targets for years now. The newer SPLM modules are deployed mostly to Central Asian based targets that may have a tie to NATO in some form. As an example, we might see extraneous data in their SSL/TLS certificates that give away information about their provider or resources. With a group like Sofacy, once their attention is detected on a network, it is important to review logins and unusual administrator access on systems, thoroughly scan and sandbox incoming attachments, and maintain two factor authentication for services like email and vpn access.

According to FireEye, the threat actors behind APT28 are after insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. Interestingly, the report (PDF) explained that that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors could contain vastly different functionality, depending on which modules were included at compile time. The threat actors also targeted attendees of European defense exhibitions, including the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo.

Unlike many attacks often attributed to China and detailed in Mandiants (now part of FireEye) APT1 report released in 2013, the APT28 attackers do not appear to be after intellectual property theft for economic gain. FireEye said the attackers have not been seen trying to steal and profit from financial account information. According to FireEye, the threat actors behind APT28 are after insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. Interestingly, the report (PDF) explained that that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors could contain vastly different functionality, depending on which modules were included at compile time. Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships, FireEye said. The threat actors also targeted attendees of European defense exhibitions, including the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo. Other probable targets identified by FireEye include:
 Norwegian Army (Forsvaret)

Isolating a sensitive computer network from the Internet can be an efficient security measure, but threat actors have found ways to get around it. Researchers identified one variant of CHOPSTICK that defeats closed networks by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. Dubbed Win32/USBStealer, the malware has been used since at least 2005 in campaigns against government organizations in Eastern Europe, researchers said. Researchers say it's uncertain how the initial infection occurs, but a likely attack vector is spear phishing. Related:"AirHopper" Malware Uses Radio Signals to Steal Data from Isolated Computers

Sofacy Attacks Overlap With Other State-Sponsored Operations


CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - Attacks carried out by a Russian threat group appear to overlap with campaigns conducted by other cyberspies, including ones linked by researchers to China and the United States. On Friday, at Kasperskys Security Analyst Summit (SAS), researcher Kurt Baumgartner revealed that the group appears to be particularly interested in military, defense and diplomatic entities in the far east. Sofacys SPLM malware (aka CHOPSTICK and X-Agent) was found on devices that had also been infected with other Turla malware, which often precedes SPLM. As the threat landscape grows ever more crowded and complex, we may encounter more examples of target overlap and it could explain why many threat actors check victim systems for the presence of other intruders before fully launching their attacks.
Kaspersky recently spotted the SPLM malware being used in an attack aimed at major air defense organization in China, while the Zebrocy tool has been used in high volume campaigns targeting entities in Armenia, Turkey, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Japan and China.

The hacker group known as APT28 -- which has been linked to Russia's GRU military intelligence and accused of attacks on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign -- managed to plant malware in the ministries' networks for possibly as long as a year, the news agency said. German security authorities only detected the online spying in December, it said, adding that an isolated government IT network had also been hit. Top security officials had repeatedly warned during Germany's 2017 general elections that Russia hackers may seek to disrupt the polls. The attack netted 17 gigabytes of data which, officials feared, could be used to blackmail MPs or discredit them.

Adobes Patch Tuesday updates for January 2018 resolve only an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Flash Player. Adobe says it has learned about the vulnerability from an anonymous researcher via Trend Micros Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). The number of vulnerabilities discovered by researchers in Flash Player has dropped significantly in the past months after Adobe announced its intention to kill the application by 2020. In October, shortly after Adobe announced that it had no Patch Tuesday updates, the company was forced to quickly release a fix for Flash Player after learning that a cyber espionage group from the Middle East had been leveraging a zero-day to deliver spyware. The same vulnerability was later exploited by the Russia-linked group APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team) in attacks aimed at government organizations and aerospace companies.

Hackers Target Czech Foreign Ministry's Email System

Prague - The Czech foreign minister said Tuesday his office had fallen prey to hackers who worked their way into the email accounts of dozens of employees including himself. "Since early January we have known one of the attacks was partly successful as the hackers managed to penetrate the email system of the ministry," Lubomir Zaoralek told reporters. The way it was done bears a very strong resemblance to the attacks on the US Democratic Party's internet system," said the foreign minister, citing experts. In early January, US intelligence said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a campaign of hacking and media manipulation aimed at undermining Clinton's presidential campaign and boosting Donald Trump. In neighboring Poland, the Rzeczpospolita daily reported Monday that a group of Russian hackers called APT28 had tried to attack local foreign ministry servers in December through emails pretending to be sent by the NATO secretary general.

FBI Attribution of 'VPNFilter' Attack Raises Questions

Researchers also spotted code similarities to the BlackEnergy malware and pointed out that there are only a few weeks until Ukraine celebrates its Constitution Day, which last year coincided with the destructive NotPetya attack. While this is not surprising, one noteworthy piece of information is that U.S. authorities say Sofacy is also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sednit, X-Agent, and Sandworm.

Several security firms have found evidence that the recent attacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the U.S. Democratic Party, were launched by Russia-linked threat groups. The actor is believed to have breached the DNCs networks as far back as the summer of 2015 using an implant dubbed SeaDaddy and a PowerShell backdoor. The malware samples contain data and programing elements that are similar to malware that we have encountered in past incident response investigations and are linked to similar threat actors, Fidelis said. An analysis of the documents leaked by Guccifer has shown that the individual might be based in Russia, and experts have pointed out several reasons why Russia could benefit from the hack.

Its worth noting that the U.S. has previously accused Russia of election-related hacks and even charged 12 intelligence officers. This pattern of behaviour demonstrates their desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences, said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Australia says there must be consequences for these types of actions and public attribution is only the first step.

CrowdStrike also pointed to a report claiming that Ukraine had lost many D-30 guns in the past years, and speculated that this cyber operation may have contributed to those losses. CrowdStrike said it had obtained the information on D-30 howitzer losses from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), but as VOA pointed out, the loss estimates actually come from a pro-Russia website that published its own interpretation of some IISS reports. Carr also highlighted that the malware-infected app may have not actually made it onto a single Ukrainian soldiers Android device, considering that each user needed to contact Sherstuk personally to obtain an activation code. Instead, they worked inside of their own research bubble, performed no verification of infected applications or tablets used by Ukraines artillery corps, and extrapolated an effect of 80% losses based upon a self-proclaimed, pro-Russian propagandist and an imaginary number of infected applications.
CrowdStrike stands by its findings and is confident that the military app has been hacked by the Fancy Bear group.

The list of known targets also includes governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Experts noted that if Pawn Storm is really a Russian group, it would make sense for it to target Turkey. Russia could have an interest in Turkey for several reasons, including the incident in which Turkey shot down a Russian warplane in the Turkey-Syria border area, disputes related to Kurdish groups, and refugees entering Europe via Turkey. The fact they have set up at least two fake OWA servers for one of the largest Turkish newspapers may also be considered as further proof that they are also after information on what is going on in major media outlets in that country, Hacquebord noted.

'Evidence' Russia Behind Cyber Attacks in Germany: Secret Service
Germany's domestic secret service said Friday it had evidence that Russia was behind a series of cyber attacks, including one that targeted the German parliament last year. The operations cited by the BfV intelligence agency ranged from an aggressive attack called Sofacy or APT 28 that hit NATO members and knocked French TV station TV5Monde off air, to a hacking campaign called Sandstorm that brought down part of Ukraine's power grid last year. It opens a new space of operations for espionage and sabotage," said Hans-Georg Maassen, who heads the BfV agency. The operation included the attempted hacking of the Dutch Safety Board's computer systems by Russian spies seeking to access a sensitive final report into the July 2014 shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine, according to security experts Trend Micro. The West has been boosting resources and tightening cooperation to fight the mounting threat of international cyber attacks, with cyber defence designated as a core NATO task.

One of these is the YARA rule included in the report, which is a tool security researchers use to classify files and to analyze infected systems for attribution purposes. web shell used by hundreds if not thousands of hackers, which makes attribution problematic. Robert M. Lee, CEO and Founder of security company Dragos, also believes that the report provides weak evidence for attribution and that the technical details included in it fail to achieve the intended purpose: it doesnt help network defenders and doesnt reveal new information on the two APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) either, although it attributes the attacks to them (yet without offering the evidence everyone was expecting). One might reasonably expect Russian intelligence operatives to develop their own tools or at least use current malicious tools from outside sources, Maunder says. But they dont appear to provide any association with Russia. It has no apparent relationship with Russian intelligence and it would be an indicator of compromise for any website, Maunder concludes. Paul Calatayud, CTO at FireMon, also told SecurityWeek that the report doesnt offer new information regarding the activities of these threat groups: Upon review, there is nothing new in regards to these actors and the techniques they are using. The newsworthy elements here are the source of the actors and their motivations in hitting political systems and implications of what it means in regards to national security.

Russia Used Android Malware to Track Ukrainian Troops: Report

The Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear has tracked Ukrainian artillery forces by planting a piece of Android malware in a legitimate military application, threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike reported on Thursday. According to CrowdStrike, Fancy Bear took the legitimate Android app and bundled it with an Android variant of X-Agent, a piece of malware that has been used by the threat actor in attacks aimed at high-value targets, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Experts believe the legitimate program had been mainly distributed through social media, not via the Google Play store. This type of strategic analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting, CrowdStrike wrote in its report. It is possible that the deployment of this malware infected application may have contributed to the high-loss nature of this platform, the report adds.

This malicious activity, dubbed by the U.S. government Grizzly Steppe, included attacks launched by two well-known Russia-linked threat groups tracked as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team) and APT29 (aka Cozy Bear and CozyDuke). However, security experts have criticized the U.S. government for failing to provide strong evidence that Russia did in fact attempt to interfere with the presidential election. After the Grizzly Steppe report was published, Burlington Electric conducted a scan of all its computers in an effort to determine if any devices had been infected with Grizzly Steppe malware. However, experts say even the new headline, Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security, is FUD. On the other hand, many experts believe the U.S. power grid is vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Russian Cyberspies Use Updated Arsenal to Attack Defense Contractors

A Russia-linked cyber espionage group has been using new tools in attacks against defense contractors and other high profile targets, Kaspersky Lab reported on Friday. The threat actor, known as Pawn Storm, Strontium, APT28, Sofacy, Sednit and Fancy Bear, has been actively targeting military, media, defense and government organizations from across the world since 2007. Entities in NATO countries have been primarily targeted, but researchers recently spotted an increase in attacks aimed at Ukraine. Up until August, Pawn Storm leveraged zero-day exploits to infect systems with JHUHUGIT and JKEYSKW first-stage implants. Older versions of USBStealer malware were analyzed by researchers at ESET in November 2014.

The group was initially known for traditional, information-stealing espionage campaigns, targeting governments in the U.S. and Europe. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT28 used spear-phishing emails that tricked recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. APT29 (aka Cozy Bear, Fritillary, the Dukes) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group which has been active since at least January 2010. Symantec has seen APT29 use a number of custom malware tools, including: Trojan.Cozer Trojan.Seaduke Trojan.Dionisduke Backdoor.Netduke Trojan.Powerduke Backdoor.Miniduke Has Symantec previously published research on APT29? How has the link between APT28, APT29, and Russia been established?
