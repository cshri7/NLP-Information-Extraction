For the roughly three decades that the commercial cybersecurity industry has existed, it has struggled with a fundamental problem  a lack of realistic attack testing to determine whether the products that companies and consumers buy actually work in stopping real in-the-wild threats. Today Im thrilled to announce that CrowdStrike Falcon, backed by our elite Falcon OverWatch team, aced the simulation  detecting and providing visibility into nearly every technique tested by the MITRE team. Our OverWatch team detects, stops and notifies our customers of about 400 serious breach attempts every single week  two per hour, on average. The one red cell below  Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (in this case, DNS)  was the only one missed by Falcon. The results of this emulation come on the heels of CrowdStrike being positioned highest for ability to execute and furthest for completeness of vision in the Visionary Quadrant of the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrantfor endpoint protection platforms, further validating our leadership position in the endpoint protection space.

For the roughly three decades that the commercial cybersecurity industry has existed, it has struggled with a fundamental problem  a lack of realistic attack testing to determine whether the products that companies and consumers buy actually work in stopping real in-the-wild threats. It is the cybersecurity equivalent of Heisenbergs uncertainty principle: The more precisely you can determine the efficacy of a security product against tested malware and exploits, the less realistic that result is, since to be tested, those threats have to be already known and widely available. Today Im thrilled to announce that CrowdStrike Falcon, backed by our elite Falcon OverWatch team, aced the simulation  detecting and providing visibility into nearly every technique tested by the MITRE team.

NSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity7. From their latest post, which contains GAOs Uber receipts, it is clear the groups information likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data. In addition, FalconIntelligence notes that following the late 2015 Sino-U.S. brief cyber detente, much of the responsibility for western cyber intrusion operations was handed to the MSS as the PLA underwent an extensive reform that is still currently underway, and which is consolidating its military cyber forces under the Strategic Support Force. Many of these adversaries have begun targeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of data.

ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxps Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account. From there, a trail of overlapping registrant details reveals ZHANGs hanzi characters for his name (), likely one of his personal home addresses, potential work addresses and several email addresses:

long@xiaohong[. ]org
baobei@xiaohong[. ]org
atreexp@yahoo[. ]com.cn 
robin4700@foxmail[. ]com
eshilong@vip.qq[. As the IntrusionTruth blog post mentions, it is a registered firm with two listed representatives, Fang Ting () and Sun Lei (), and a listed address of 1906 Fuyu Mansion (1-1906). This is interesting considering STONE PANDAs extensive targeting of Japanese defense firms after this time period, but it is by no means conclusive evidence that the firm is connected to STONE PANDA.

The MsnMM Campaigns [pdf]  For over half a decade, the Naikon APT waged multiple attack campaigns on sensitive targets throughout South-eastern Asia and around the South China Sea. Targets and victims included ASEAN governmental agencies and government departments, investment enterprises, military, law enforcement and border control organizations, embassies, university faculties and others. The Naikon attackers attempted to exfiltrate sensitive geo-political, military, and economic data; to intercept communications and to maintain surveillance on their victims throughout the MsnMM campaigns. Their toolset and techniques changed over time in many minor ways, and appear to be run by Chinese-speaking individuals. The consistent list of military, economic, and political targets gave away the actors interests.

Considering the volume of Naikon activity observed and its relentless, repeated attack attempts, such a confrontation was worth looking into, so we did. It is hardly surprising that there is an element of overlap, considering both actors have for years mined victims in the South China Sea area, apparently in search of geo-political intelligence. There are no fundamental differences between modifications; its just that extra features get added to the latest versions, such as compression and encryption of transmitted data, or the piecemeal download of large files. d085ba82824c1e61e93e113a705b8e9a  118272  Aug 23 18:46:57 2012    b4a8dc9eb26e727eafb6c8477963829c  140800  May 20 11:56:38 2013    172fd9cce78de38d8cbcad605e3d6675  118784  Jun 13 12:14:40 2013    d74a7e7a4de0da503472f1f051b68745  190464  Aug 19 05:30:12 2013    93e84075bef7a11832d9c5aa70135dc6  154624  Jan 07 04:39:43 2014      CC-Proxy-Op  C&C server operations are characterized by the following:   Low maintenance requirements  Organized geo-specific task assignments  Different approaches to communication   The C&C servers must have required only a few operators to manage the entire network.

In November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon learned from Pentagon intelligence officials that this company had been working with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to develop spyware-laden security products that would be loaded onto computers and phones. Companies in sectors that have been victimized by APT3 now must adjust their strategies to defend against the resources and technology of the Chinese government.

FireEye reported last week that APT3, a threat actor believed to be sponsored by China, had targeted two Hong Kong government agencies in early August. APT3, also known as UPS Team, Gothic Panda, Buckeye and TG-0110, has been active since at least 2009. However, Symantec, which tracks the threat actor as Buckeye, noticed last year that the hackers had become increasingly interested in Hong Kong. In the recent attacks observed by Symantec, mostly aimed at political entities in Hong Kong, APT3 used ZIP archives and Windows shortcut (.lnk) files to deliver a backdoor dubbed by the security firm Pirpi. In addition to Pirpi, Symantec observed APT3 using various other tools, including keyloggers, remote command execution tools, system information harvesting tools, and browser password stealers.

An exploit for a Flash Player vulnerability patched by Adobe last week with the release of version 18.0.0.194 has been integrated into the Magnitude exploit kit. The existence of the heap buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113) that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution was brought to light by FireEye. The expert reported on Sunday that cybercriminals have been using the exploit to deliver the Cryptowall ransomware. In late May, an exploit for a Flash Player bug fixed by Adobe on May 11 was added to the Angler exploit kit. Once a new exploit has been introduced in one kit, its pretty easy for others to copy it, Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure, told SecurityWeek earlier this month.

Their research led to two individuals, named Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao, who apparently registered many of the domains used by the threat actor. Researchers noticed last year that the group had shifted its attention from the U.S. and the U.K. to Hong Kong, where it had mainly targeted political entities using a backdoor dubbed Pirpi.
CrowdStrike has seen an uptick in activity by the group since 2016, Meyers said. Researchers said the group appears to be focusing on file and print servers, which suggests they are mainly interested in stealing documents to support their espionage efforts. These conspirators masked their criminal conspiracy by exploiting unwitting computers, called hop points, conducting spearphish email campaigns to gain unauthorized access to corporate computers, and deploying malicious code to infiltrate the victim computer networks.

The script, dubbed by FireEye WITCHCOVEN, collects the victims computer and browser configuration and deploys a persistent tracking cookie, also known as a supercookie, on their device. For example, if the attackers determine that the targeted user is running outdated software that is known to contain serious vulnerabilities, they can easily hack their machine using available exploits, without the need to expose zero-days. FireEye says this tactic has been used in targeted operations by other APT groups, including the Chinese actor APT3 in Operation Clandestine Wolf, and the Russian group APT28 in Operation Russian Doll.
