Mean Scored Summary
-------------------
APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabias military aviation capabilities to enhance Irans domestic aviation capabilities or to support Irans military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia. Iran has expressed interest ingrowing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies. Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting  Spear Phishing  APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file  We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016. As shown in Figure 3, the fake mail phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[. Figure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)  Figure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell. Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values  Domain Masquerading  APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudis military and commercial fleet. Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government  We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries. Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources. APT33s focus on aviation may indicate the groups desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Irans aviation capabilities or to support Irans military and strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production. ]com   TURNEDUP   www.securityupdated[. ]net   TURNEDUP   syn.broadcaster[.

Since mid-2016, the security firm has spotted attacks aimed by this group at the aviation sector, including military and commercial aviation, and energy companies with connections to petrochemical production. According to FireEye, the cyber espionage group sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year. DROPSHOT was previously analyzed by Kaspersky, which tracks it as StoneDrill. Iran appears to have several cyber espionage groups, including Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten and CopyKittens.

Five Threat Groups Target Industrial Systems: Dragos

There are at least five sophisticated threat groups whose activities focus on industrial control systems (ICS), according to a report published on Thursday by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos. While its not uncommon for non-targeted malware to make its way onto industrial systems, targeted attacks have also become increasingly common. While some media reports portrayed APT33 as a serious threat to ICS and critical infrastructure, Dragos investigation showed that the group does not appear to possess any ICS-specific capabilities. While only one [of these groups] has demonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware directly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the ICS environment, Dragos said.

There are at least five sophisticated threat groups whose activities focus on industrial control systems (ICS), according to a report published on Thursday by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos. While its not uncommon for non-targeted malware to make its way onto industrial systems, targeted attacks have also become increasingly common. Dragos report also summarizes the activities of Dymalloy, a group whose attacks came to light during an investigation into Dragonfly, an actor that is also known as Crouching Yeti and Energetic Bear. Dragonfly, which is believed to be operating out of Russia, is known for its sophisticated Havex malware, and it was recently observed targeting control systems in U.S. energy firms. Chrysene, which continues to be active, has used a unique variation of a framework associated with the Iran-linked cyber espionage groups known as OilRig and Greenbug. While some media reports portrayed APT33 as a serious threat to ICS and critical infrastructure, Dragos investigation showed that the group does not appear to possess any ICS-specific capabilities. While only one [of these groups] has demonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware directly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the ICS environment, Dragos said.

The hackers, tracked as APT35 and also known as NewsBeef, Newscaster, and Charming Kitten, have been active since at least 2011, with their activities detailed for the first time several years ago. In December 2017, ClearSky Cyber Security published a report detailing the groups activities during the 2016-2017 timeframe. The advanced persistent threat (APT) apparently copied entire pages from the legitimate website, but also changed one of them to include a sign in option with multiple services. These sign in options are all phishing pages that would send the victim's credentials to the attackers. The fake website started being flagged as deceptive soon after ClearSky discovered it.

One of the pages on the fake website, the security researchers discovered, featured content related to a Charming Kitten campaign that ClearSky exposed only several weeks ago. The fake website started being flagged as deceptive soon after ClearSky discovered it.

Industry Reactions to Iran Cyber Retaliation Over U.S. Nuclear Deal Exit

President Donald Trump announced this week that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on the Middle Eastern country. Many experts fear that Iran will retaliate by launching cyberattacks on Western organizations. Industry professionals contacted by SecurityWeek all say that there is a strong possibility of attacks, but they mostly agree that Iran will likely not try to cause too much damage as that could lead to massive response from the United States and its allies. And the feedback begins...
