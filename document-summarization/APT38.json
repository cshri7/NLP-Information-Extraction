[{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT38","text":"Today, we are releasing details on the threat group that we believe is responsible for conducting financial crime on behalf of the North Korean regime, stealing millions of dollars from banks worldwide. The group is particularly aggressive; they regularly use destructive malware to render victim networks inoperable following theft. More importantly, diplomatic efforts, including the recent Department of Justice (DOJ) complaint that outlined attribution to North Korea, have thus far failed to put an end to their activity. We are calling this group APT38.  We are releasing a special report, APT38: Un-usual Suspects , to expose the methods used by this active and serious threat, and to complement earlier efforts by others to expose these operations, using FireEye\u2019s unique insight into the attacker lifecycle.  We believe APT38\u2019s financial motivation, unique toolset, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed during their carefully executed operations are distinct enough to be tracked separately from other North Korean cyber activity. There are many overlapping characteristics with other operations, known as \u201cLazarus\u201d and the actor we call TEMP.Hermit ; however, we believe separating this group will provide defenders with a more focused understanding of the adversary and allow them to prioritize resources and enable defense. The following are some of the ways APT38 is different from other North Korean actors, and some of the ways they are similar:   We find there are clear distinctions between APT38 activity and the activity of other North Korean actors, including the actor we call TEMP.Hermit. Our investigation indicates they are disparate operations against different targets and reliance on distinct TTPs; however, the malware tools being used either overlap or exhibit shared characteristics, indicating a shared developer or access to the same code repositories. As evident in the DOJ complaint, there are other shared resources, such as personnel who may be assisting multiple efforts.  A 2016 Novetta report detailed the work of security vendors attempting to unveil tools and infrastructure related to the 2014 destructive attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. This report detailed malware and TTPs related to a set of developers and operators they dubbed \u201cLazarus,\u201d a name that has become synonymous with aggressive North Korean cyber operations.  Since then, public reporting attributed additional activity to the \u201cLazarus\u201d group with varying levels of confidence primarily based on malware similarities being leveraged in identified operations. Over time, these malware similarities diverged, as did targeting, intended outcomes and TTPs, almost certainly indicating that this activity is made up of multiple operational groups primarily linked together with shared malware development resources and North Korean state sponsorship.     Since at least 2014, APT38 has conducted operations in more than 16 organizations in at least 13 countries, sometimes simultaneously, indicating that the group is a large, prolific operation with extensive resources. The following are some details about APT38 targeting:   The total number of organizations targeted by APT38 may be even higher when considering the probable low incident reporting rate from affected organizations.  APT38 is characterized by long planning, extended periods of access to compromised victim environments preceding any attempts to steal money, fluency across mixed operating system environments, the use of custom developed tools, and a constant effort to thwart investigations capped with a willingness to completely destroy compromised machines afterwards.  The group is careful, calculated, and has demonstrated a desire to maintain access to a victim environment for as long as necessary to understand the network layout, required permissions, and system technologies to achieve its goals.  On average, we have observed APT38 remain within a victim network for approximately 155 days, with the longest time within a compromised environment believed to be almost two years.  In just the publicly reported heists alone, APT38 has attempted to steal over $1.1 billion dollars from financial institutions.   Investigating intrusions of many victimized organizations has provided us with a unique perspective into APT38\u2019s entire attack lifecycle. Figure 1 contains a breakdown of observed malware families used by APT38 during the different stages of their operations. At a high-level, their targeting of financial organizations and subsequent heists have followed the same general pattern:   Information Gathering : Conducted research into an organization\u2019s personnel and targeted third party vendors with likely access to SWIFT transaction systems to understand the mechanics of SWIFT transactions on victim networks (Please note: The systems in question are those used by the victim to conduct SWIFT transactions. At no point did we observe these actors breach the integrity of the SWIFT system itself.).  Initial Compromise : Relied on watering holes and exploited an insecure out-of-date version of Apache Struts2 to execute code on a system.  Internal Reconnaissance : Deployed malware to gather credentials, mapped the victim\u2019s network topology, and used tools already present in the victim environment to scan systems.  Pivot to Victim Servers Used for SWIFT Transactions : Installed reconnaissance malware and internal network monitoring tools on systems used for SWIFT to further understand how they are configured and being used. Deployed both active and passive backdoors on these systems to access segmented internal systems at a victim organization and avoid detection.  Transfer funds : Deployed and executed malware to insert fraudulent SWIFT transactions and alter transaction history. Transferred funds via multiple transactions to accounts set up in other banks, usually located in separate countries to enable money laundering.  Destroy Evidence : Securely deleted logs, as well as deployed and executed disk-wiping malware, to cover tracks and disrupt forensic analysis.    Figure 1: APT38 Attack Lifecycle  APT38 is unique in that it is not afraid to aggressively destroy evidence or victim networks as part of its operations. This attitude toward destruction is probably a result of the group trying to not only cover its tracks, but also to provide cover for money laundering operations.  In addition to cyber operations, public reporting has detailed recruitment and cooperation of individuals in-country to support with the tail end of APT38\u2019s thefts, including persons responsible for laundering funds and interacting with recipient banks of stolen funds. This adds to the complexity and necessary coordination amongst multiple components supporting APT38 operations.  Despite recent efforts to curtail their activity, APT38 remains active and dangerous to financial institutions worldwide. By conservative estimates, this actor has stolen over a hundred million dollars, which would be a major return on the likely investment necessary to orchestrate these operations. Furthermore, given the sheer scale of the thefts they attempt, and their penchant for destroying targeted networks, APT38 should be considered a serious risk to the sector.","url":"https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/\/blog\/threat-research\/2018\/10\/apt38-details-on-new-north-korean-regime-backed-threat-group.html"},{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT38","text":"North Korean Attacks on Banks Attributed to 'APT38' Group\r\n\nA report published on Wednesday by FireEye details the activities of a financially motivated threat actor believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean government.\nThe group, tracked by FireEye as APT38, focuses on targeting financial institutions, and the company\u2019s researchers estimate that it has stolen at least a hundred million dollars from banks worldwide. It\u2019s believed that the group has attempted to steal over $1.1 billion.\nMuch of the North Korea-linked cyber activity has been attributed to the notorious Lazarus, but cybersecurity firms have begun to realize that, similar to other countries, there are actually several groups that appear to be launching attacks on behalf of the government. The fact that their tools, techniques and infrastructure often overlap makes it difficult to accurately attribute an operation to a certain group.\nFireEye noted that there are many similarities between APT38 and attacks launched by other North Korea-linked groups, including Lazarus and the activity it tracks as TEMP.Hermit. However, it believes APT38\u2019s tools and its tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are distinct enough for it to be tracked separately.\nSome other security firms have also noticed that the financially motivated attacks linked to Lazarus may have actually been carried out by a subgroup of Lazarus. Kaspersky has tracked this subgroup as Bluenoroff, while CrowdStrike has dubbed it Stardust Chollima. CrowdStrike has been tracking a total of four subgroups, which it has named Stardust Chollima, Silent Chollima, Labyrinth Chollima and Ricochet Chollima.\nAccording to FireEye, APT38 has been active since at least 2014 and it has been observed targeting over 16 organizations across 11 countries \u2013 researchers believe the actual number of targets may be higher.\n\nSeveral of these attacks made headlines in the past years and the researchers who analyzed them reported seeing significant similarities to Lazarus campaigns. However, FireEye says the attacks were actually carried out by APT38. The attacks, many of which targeted the SWIFT banking system, were aimed, among others, at Vietnam\u2019s TP Bank in 2015, Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in 2016, Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International in 2017, Bancomext in Mexico in 2018, and Banco de Chile also in 2018.\n\u201cAttribution to both the \u2018Lazarus\u2019 group and TEMP.Hermit was made with varying levels of confidence primarily based on similarities in malware being leveraged in identified operations,\u201d FireEye said in its report on APT38. \u201cOver time these malware similarities diverged, as did targeting, intended outcomes, and TTPs, almost certainly indicating that TEMP.Hermit activity is made up of multiple operational groups primarily linked together with shared malware development resources and North Korean state sponsorship.\u201d\nFireEye believes that several other attacks that made the news \u2013 involving banks in Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Ecuador, and India \u2013 may have also been carried out by APT38 based on timing, location, malware, general TTPs and the fact that they targeted SWIFT systems.\nUnlike other North Korean threat groups, APT38\u2019s attacks are almost exclusively cyber heists whose likely goal is to raise money for the regime. On the other hand, unlike typical cybercrime operations, APT38\u2019s campaigns are more similar to espionage.\n\u201cAPT38 executes sophisticated bank heists typically featuring long planning, extended periods of access to compromised victim environments preceding any attempts to steal money, fluency across mixed operating system environments, the use of custom developed tools, and a constant effort to thwart investigations capped with a willingness to completely destroy compromised machines afterwards,\u201d FireEye said.\nExperts believe APT38 was created by North Korea as a result of the sanctions imposed on the country. The group was first spotted in February 2014, roughly one year after the UN blocked the regime from making bulk cash transfers and restricting its ties to international banking systems. As more and more sanctions were imposed on North Korea in the following years, APT38 escalated its activities and the frequency of attacks increased.\nFireEye has warned that APT38 continues to be active, even after the United States named and charged an alleged North Korean hacker who is said to have been involved in the development of Lazarus tools.\nRelated: U.S. Links North Korean Government to ATM Hacks\nRelated: NKorea Said to Have Stolen a Fortune in Online Bank Heists","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/north-korean-attacks-banks-attributed-apt38-group"},{"Unnamed: 0":1,"query":"APT38","text":"NKorea Said to Have Stolen a Fortune in Online Bank Heists\r\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests have stopped, but its hacking operations to gather intelligence and raise funds for the sanction-strapped government in Pyongyang may be gathering steam.\nU.S. security firm FireEye raised the alarm Wednesday over a North Korean group that it says has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars by infiltrating the computer systems of banks around the world since 2014 through highly sophisticated and destructive attacks that have spanned at least 11 countries. It says the group is still operating and poses \u201can active global threat.\u201d\nIt is part of a wider pattern of malicious state-backed cyber activity that has led the Trump administration to identify North Korea \u2014 along with Russia, Iran and China \u2014 as one of the main online threats facing the United States. Last month, the Justice Department charged a North Korean hacker said to have conspired in devastating cyberattacks, including an $81 million heist of Bangladesh\u2019s central bank and the WannaCry virus that crippled parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned of the use of malware by Hidden Cobra, the U.S. government\u2019s byword for North Korea hackers, in fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals from banks in Asia and Africa. It said that Hidden Cobra was behind the theft of tens of millions of dollars from teller machines in the past two years. In one incident this year, cash had been simultaneously withdrawn from ATMs in 23 different countries, it said.\nNorth Korea, which prohibits access to the world wide web for virtually all its people, has previously denied involvement in cyberattacks, and attribution for such attacks is rarely made with absolute certainty. It is typically based on technical indicators such as the Internet Protocol addresses that identify computers and characteristics of the coding used in malware, which is the software a hacker may use to damage or disable computers.\nBut other cybersecurity experts tell The Associated Press that they also see continued signs that North Korea\u2019s authoritarian government, which has a long track record of criminality to raise cash, is conducting malign activity online. That activity includes targeting of financial institutions and crypto-currency-related organizations, as well as spying on its adversaries, despite the easing of tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.\n\u201cThe reality is they are starved for cash and are continuing to try and generate revenue, at least until sanctions are diminished,\u201d said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. \u201cAt the same time, they won\u2019t abate in intelligence collection operations, as they continue to negotiate and test the international community\u2019s resolve and test what the boundaries are.\u201d\nCrowdStrike says it has detected continuing North Korean cyber intrusions in the past two months, including the use of a known malware against a potentially broad set of targets in South Korea, and a new variant of malware against users of mobile devices that use a Linux-based operating system.\nThis activity has been taking place against the backdrop of a dramatic diplomatic shift as Kim Jong Un has opened up to the world. He has held summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and with President Donald Trump, who hopes to persuade Kim to relinquish the nuclear weapons that pose a potential threat to the U.S. homeland. Tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula have dropped and fears of war with the U.S. have ebbed. Trump this weekend will dispatch his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, to Pyongyang for the fourth time this year to make progress on denuclearization.\nBut North Korea has yet to take concrete steps to give up its nuclear arsenal, so there\u2019s been no let-up in sanctions that have been imposed to deprive it of fuel and revenue for its weapons programs, and to block it from bulk cash transfers and accessing to the international banking system.\nFireEye says APT38, the name it gives to the hacking group dedicated to bank theft, has emerged and stepped up its operations since February 2014 as the economic vise on North Korea has tightened in response to its nuclear and missile tests. Initial operations targeted financial institutions in Southeast Asia, where North Korea had experience in money laundering, but then expanded into other regions such as Latin America and Africa, and then extended to Europe and North America.\nIn all, FireEye says APT38 has attempted to steal $1.1 billion, and based on the data it can confirm, has gotten away with hundreds of millions in dollars. It has used malware to insert fraudulent transactions in the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication or SWIFT system that is used to transfer money between banks. Its biggest heist to date was $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February 2016. The funds were wired to bank accounts established with fake identities in the Philippines. After the funds were withdrawn they were suspected to have been laundered in casinos.\nThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank, said in a report Wednesday that North Korea\u2019s cyber capabilities provide an alternative means for challenging its adversaries. While Kim\u2019s hereditary regime appears to prioritize currency generation, attacks using the SWIFT system raise concerns that North Korean hackers \u201cmay become more proficient at manipulating the data and systems that undergird the global financial system,\u201d it says.\nSandra Joyce, FireEye\u2019s head of global intelligence, said that while APT38 is a criminal operation, it leverages the skills and technology of a state-backed espionage campaign, allowing it to infiltrate multiple banks at once and figure how to extract funds. On average, it dwells in a bank\u2019s computer network for 155 days to learn about its systems before it tries to steal anything. And when it finally pounces, it uses aggressive malware to wreak havoc and cover its tracks.\n\u201cWe see this as a consistent effort, before, during and after any diplomatic efforts by the United States and the international community,\u201d said Joyce, describing North Korea as being \u201cundeterred\u201d and urging the U.S. government to provide more specific threat information to financial institutions about APT38\u2032s modus operandi. APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat.\nThe Silicon Valley-based company says it is aware of continuing, suspected APT38 operations against other banks. The most recent attack it is publicly attributing to APT38 was against of Chile\u2019s biggest commercial banks, Banco de Chile, in May this year. The bank has said a hacking operation robbed it of $10 million.\nFireEye, which is staffed with a roster of former military and law-enforcement cyberexperts, conducted malware analysis for a criminal indictment by the Justice Department last month against Park Jin Hyok, the first time a hacker said to be from North Korea has faced U.S. criminal charges. He\u2019s accused of conspiring in a number of devastating cyberattacks: the Bangladesh heist and other attempts to steal more than $1 billion from financial institutions around the world; the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures Entertainment; and the WannaCry ransomware virus that in 2017 infected computers in 150 countries.\nRelated: U.S. Links North Korean Government to ATM Hacks","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/nkorea-said-have-stolen-fortune-online-bank-heists"}]
