[{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT32","text":"Cyber espionage actors, now designated by FireEye as APT32 (OceanLotus Group), are carrying out intrusions into private sector companies across multiple industries and have also targeted foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists. FireEye assesses that APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests.  APT32 and FireEye\u2019s Community Response  In the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam, FireEye\u2019s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered activity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion campaign. In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team launched a Community Protection Event (CPE) \u2013 a coordinated effort between Mandiant incident responders, FireEye as a Service (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye product engineering \u2013 to protect all clients from APT32 activity.  In the following weeks, FireEye released threat intelligence products and updated malware profiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for APT32\u2019s tools and phishing lures. This focused intelligence and detection effort led to new external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye\u2019s newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32.  APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in Southeast Asia  Since at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam\u2019s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors. Furthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations.  Here is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:   In 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a manufacturing facility in Vietnam.  In 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security, technology infrastructure, banking, and media industries were targeted.  In mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on the networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand operations into Vietnam.  From 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S. and Philippine consumer products corporations, located inside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations.   Table 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in each.

Here is an overview of this activity:   A public blog published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicated that journalists, activists, dissidents, and bloggers were targeted in 2013 by malware and tactics consistent with APT32 operations.  In 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled \u201cPlans to crackdown on protesters at the Embassy of Vietnam.exe,\" which targeted dissident activity among the Vietnamese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an intrusion against a Western country\u2019s national legislature.  In 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360, released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and private entities including government agencies, research institutes, maritime agencies, sea construction, and shipping enterprises. The information included in the report indicated that the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping infrastructure, and similar targets as APT32.  In 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that FireEye assesses to be unique to APT32.  In 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that they were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well as government employees in the Philippines.   APT32 Tactics  In their current campaign, APT32 has leveraged ActiveMime files that employ social engineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros. Upon execution, the initialized file downloads multiple malicious payloads from remote servers. APT32 actors continue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.  APT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific victims. Although the files had \u201c.doc\u201d file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were ActiveMime \u201c.mht\u201d web page archives that contained text and images. These files were likely created by exporting Word documents into single file web pages.  Table 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files.

When opened, many lure files displayed fake error messages in an attempt to trick users into launching the malicious macros. Figure 1 shows a fake Gmail-theme paired with a hexadecimal error code that encourages the recipient to enable content to resolve the error. Figure 2 displays another APT32 lure that used a convincing image of a fake Windows error message instructing the recipient to enable content to properly display document font characters.  Figure 1: Example APT32 Phishing Lure \u2013 Fake Gmail Error Message  Figure 2: Example APT32 Phishing Lure \u2013 Fake Text Encoding Error Message  APT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their phishing, monitor the distribution of their malicious documents, and establish persistence mechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory.  In order to track who opened the phishing emails, viewed the links, and downloaded the attachments in real-time, APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for sales organizations. In some instances, APT32 abandoned direct email attachments altogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their ActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services.  To enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures, APT32 utilized the native web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external images hosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure.  Figure 3 contains an example phishing lure with HTML image tags used for additional tracking by APT32.  Figure 3: Phishing Lure Containing HTML Image Tags for Additional Tracking  When a document with this feature is opened, Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist. Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms.  Once macros were enabled on the target system, the malicious macros created two named scheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected system. The first named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first backdoor from APT32\u2019s infrastructure and injected it into memory. The second named scheduled task, loaded as an XML file to falsify task attributes, ran a JavaScript code block that downloaded and launched a secondary backdoor, delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script. In most lures, one scheduled task persisted an APT32-specific backdoor and the other scheduled task initialized a commercially-available backdoor as backup.  To illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence mechanisms for recovered APT32 lure \u201c2017\u5e74\u5458\u5de5\u5de5\u8d44\u6027\u6d25\u8d34\u989d\u7edf\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a.doc\u201d.  Figure 4: APT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks  In this example, a scheduled task named \u201cWindows Scheduled Maintenance\u201d was created to run Casey Smith\u2019s \u201cSquiblydoo\u201d App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes. While all payloads can be dynamically updated, at the time of delivery, this task launched a COM scriptlet (\u201c.sct\u201d file extension) that downloaded and executed Meterpreter hosted on images.chinabytes[.]info. Meterpreter then loaded Cobalt Strike BEACON, configured to communicate with 80.255.3[.]87 using the Safebrowsing malleable C2 profile to further blend in with network traffic. A second scheduled task named \u201cScheduled Defrags\u201d was created by loading the raw task XML with a backdated task creation timestamp of June 2, 2016. This second task ran \u201cmshta.exe\u201d every 50 minutes which launched an APT32-specific backdoor delivered as shellcode in a PowerShell script, configured to communicate with the domains blog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and yii.yiihao126[.]net.  Figure 5 illustrates the chain of events for a single successful APT32 phishing lure that dynamically injects two multi-stage malware frameworks into memory.  Figure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events  The impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim environments. Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access, APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon\u2019s Invoke-Obfuscation framework.  APT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity:   During one investigation, APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit (CVE-2016-7255) masquerading as a Windows hotfix.  In another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to distribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled the payload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol.  APT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their malware on a system. For example, APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent service with a legitimate service name that had a Unicode no-break space character appended to it. Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename padded with a non-printing OS command control code.   APT32 Malware and Infrastructure  APT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite of backdoors spanning multiple protocols. APT32 operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO, SOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL. APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the commercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor. APT32 may also possess backdoor development capabilities for macOS .  The capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3.   Malware   Capabilities   WINDSHIELD    Command and control (C2) communications via TCP raw sockets  Four configured C2s and six configured ports \u2013 randomly-chosen C2\/port for communications  Registry manipulation  Get the current module's file name  Gather system information including registry values, user name, computer name, and current code page  File system interaction including directory creation, file deletion, reading, and writing files  Load additional modules and execute code  Terminate processes  Anti-disassembly    KOMPROGO    Fully-featured backdoor capable of process, file, and registry management  Creating a reverse shell  File transfers  Running WMI queries  Retrieving information about the infected system    SOUNDBITE    C2 communications via DNS  Process creation  File upload  Shell command execution  File and directory enumeration\/manipulation  Window enumeration  Registry manipulation  System information gathering    PHOREAL    C2 communications via ICMP  Reverse shell creation  Filesystem manipulation  Registry manipulation  Process creation  File upload    BEACON (Cobalt Strike)    Publicly available payload that can inject and execute arbitrary code into processes  Impersonating the security context of users  Importing Kerberos tickets  Uploading and downloading files  Executing shell commands  Configured with malleable C2 profiles to blend in with normal network traffic  Co-deployment and interoperability with Metasploit framework  SMB Named Pipe in-memory backdoor payload that enables peer-to-peer C2 and pivoting over SMB     Table 3: APT32 Malware and Capabilities  APT32 operators appear to be well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure. The FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on these backdoor families based on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions.  Figure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of the attack lifecycle.  Figure 6: APT32 Attack Lifecycle  Outlook and Implications  Based on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence observations along with additional publications on the same operators, FireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests. The targeting of private sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye believes the actor poses significant risk to companies doing business in, or preparing to invest in, the country. While the motivation for each APT32 private sector compromise varied \u2013 and in some cases was unknown \u2013 the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement, intellectual property theft, or anticorruption measures that could ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations. Furthermore, APT32 continues to threaten political activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the public sector worldwide. Governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam diaspora may continue to be targeted.  While actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea remain the most active cyber espionage threats tracked and responded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability. APT32 demonstrates how accessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and the flexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques. As more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets.

Published yesterday, the report shows it to be a sophisticated and well-resourced cyber espionage actor targeting Vietnamese interests around the globe -- and although not-previously classified in the APTn schema, it has been operating since at least 2013. The APT designation was also commenced back in 2013, when Mandiant used it to describe the first hacking group, APT1, that it was willing to call 'state-sponsored'.\nFireEye's analysis stops short of defining APT32 as another state-sponsored hacking group; but that is the clear suspicion. \"APT32,\" writes Nick Carr, senior manager of FireEye's Mandiant Incident Response team, \"leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests.\"\nHe subsequently told Reuters it was impossible to identify or locate the hackers precisely or confirm they were working for the Vietnamese government but the information they sought would be of very little use to any other party. He also said that in some cases the intrusions seemed to be assessing the victims' adherence to national regulations.\nThe Vietnamese government denies this. \"The government of Vietnam does not allow any form of cyber-attacks against organizations or individuals,\" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang. \"All cyber-attacks or threats to cybersecurity, must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and laws.\"\nThe APT32 targets include a European corporation that was about to construct a manufacturing facility in Vietnam in 2014; numerous Vietnamese and foreign corporations in 2016; a hospitality developer planning to expand operations in Vietnam in 2016; and the Vietnamese offices of a global consulting firm in 2017. In all cases, espionage would give the Vietnam government either a commercial advantage in discussions, or greater understanding of foreign companies within the country.\nOther attacks, however, have been targeted at individuals outside of Vietnam -- more specifically governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam diaspora who, warns Carr, \"may continue to be targeted.\"\nFireEye's isolation of APT32 followed its investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam. These investigations provided \"sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye's newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32.\"\nFireEye's analysis of APT32's current campaign depicts a well-resourced and innovative attacker. It uses phishing emails containing a weaponized attachment. Unusually, the attachment is not a Word document but an ActiveMime (an undocumented Microsoft format) file. This file contains an OLE file containing malicious macros.\nThe attacker also used a novel approach to track the success of its phishing emails, using legitimate cloud-based email analytics. The phishing attachment can contain HTML image tags. \"When a document with this feature is opened,\" writes Carr, \"Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist. Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms.\"\nIf the macros are successfully loaded, they create two scheduled tasks to act as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors. The first launches Squiblydoo, an application whitelisting script protection bypass, to enable the download of a backdoor from APT's infrastructure. The second leads to a secondary backdoor delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script configured to communicate with the domains blog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and yii.yiihao126[.]net.\nAPT32's persistence and obfuscation goes further. \"Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access, APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon's Invoke-Obfuscation framework,\" notes the analysis.\nIt is APT32's use of a custom suite of backdoors that has helped FireEye tie different campaigns to this one particular group. That suite includes Windshield, Komprogo, Soundbite, Phoreal, and Beacon. \"FireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests,\" writes Carr. He warns that APT32 demonstrates that state-sponsored cyber espionage is no longer necessarily limited to the few known actors: China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea.\n\"As more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/apt32-vietnamese-hackers-target-foreign-corporations"},{"Unnamed: 0":1,"query":"APT32","text":"How APT32 Hacked a Global Asian Firm With Persistence\r\n\nIn a cyber intrusion dubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty, the OceanLotus hacking group -- otherwise known as APT32 -- played cat-and-mouse with a security firm that was tracking its every move.\nCybereason\u00a0(a Boston, Mass.-based provider of threat detection solutions)\u00a0had been employed by a large global firm operating in Asia that suspected, but could not locate, a breach. The investigators found evidence of an ongoing intrusion by advanced hackers it recognized as the OceanLotus Group. Earlier this month, FireEye all but declared the group -- designated by FireEye as APT32 - to be a Vietnamese nation-state actor.\u00a0\nCybereason's investigation showed that this group had been inside the Asian firm for more than a year before it was discovered. Furthermore, the attacker took ongoing evasive action to retain its presence even though it almost certainly knew it had been detected.\nDuring the investigation, Cybereason found more than 70 payloads and numerous domains. It discovered six custom-built tools that it considers to be the OceanLotus Group's signature tools. FireEye's report noted five such tools; but Cybereason also detected Backdoor.Win32.Denis, first described by Kaspersky just last month, which it now adds to the OceanLotus armory. Win32.Denis uses DNS tunneling for C&C communications.\nCybereason was able to uncover the entire lifecycle of the Cobalt Kitty operation. The attack started with targeted spear-phishing emails: one with a link to a fake Flash installer and another with an attached weaponized Office document. The Word document contained a malicious macro that creates persistence on the compromised machine using two scheduled tasks. In both cases, the end purpose was to download secondary payloads including Cobalt Strike Beacon.\nThe process is 'fileless'. Persistence is maintained through the Windows registry, services and scheduled tasks. A PowerShell script is used to fetch Cobalt Strike Beacon, which also operates in memory.\nCybereason reported its discoveries to the client, who then used both Windows Group Policy Object (GPO) and Cybereason's execution prevention feature that prevents PowerShell execution. But the attacker didn't give up -- the group adapted, initially concentrating on its own custom and stealthy backdoors. It then resumed the PowerShell operation. \"The attackers used a modified version of a publicly available tool called PSUnlock to bypass the PowerShell execution restrictions,\" notes the report.\nCybereason suspects that the group were ready and prepared for this scenario. \"The attackers' remarkable ability to quickly adapt,\" suggests Cybereason, \"demonstrates their skill and familiarity with and command of the company's internal network and its operations.\"\u00a0\nThe attacker also used DLL hijacking leveraging Windows Search, Google Update and Kaspersky's Avpia to load fake DLLs containing malicious code. It used DNS tunneling for C2 communication and data exfiltration. \"To ensure that the DNS traffic will not be filtered,\" reports Cybereason, \"the attackers configured the backdoor to communicate with Google and OpenDNS DNS servers, since most organizations and security products will not filter traffic to those two major DNS services.\"\nIt also employed an innovative additional and difficult-to-detect C2 channel by installing a backdoor macro in Outlook. It was able to execute commands, deploy tools and steal data via email. The macro looks for incoming commands, deletes the relevant email, executes the discovered commands from the deleted items folder, and finally deletes all evidence of the emails sent or received from the attackers.\n\"This backdoor has not been publicly documented,\" says Cybereason, \"and is one of the most unique TTPs with regards to the threat actor. Outlook backdoors are not a new concept and have been observed in different APTs in the past. However, this specific type of Outlook backdoor can be considered as one of the 'signature tools' of the OceanLotus Group.\"\nSimilar to the methodology attributed by FireEye to APT32, the group combined its custom backdoors with freely available tools; for example, using Mimikatz as the primary tool to obtain credentials and aid lateral movement.\nThroughout the operation, the OceanLotus Group showed a preference for using and adapting such publicly available tools. \"However, the attackers should not be considered script-kiddies,\" says the report. \"Most of the publicly available tools were either obfuscated, modified and even merged with other tools to evade antivirus detection. This type of customization requires good coding skills and understanding of how those tools work.\"\nCybereason does not go as far as FireEye in suggesting that OceanLotus may be state-sponsored, but it describes the group as \"determined and motivated... they never gave up, even when part of their attack infrastructure was exposed and shut down by the defenders.\"\u00a0It doesn't name the victim firm, nor does it specifically tie the intrusion to Vietnamese interests. All that Cybereason would tell SecurityWeek is, \"We can only specify that the attackers are targeting a global corporation in Asia.\"\nNevertheless, a wider analysis of OceanLotus suggests that \"Most of the samples caught in-the-wild seem to target Vietnamese speakers. Some of the samples exhibit clear evidence of targeting Vietnamese entities.\"\nAs for the group itself, Operation Cobalt Kitty outlines attackers with \"a remarkable ability to quickly adapt, introduce new tools and fine tune existing ones to bypass security solutions and avoid detection. The high number of payloads and the elaborate C2 infrastructure used in this attack can be indicative of the resources that the attackers had at their disposal. Simultaneously orchestrating multiple APT campaigns of such magnitude and sophistication takes time, financial resources and a large team who can support it.\"\nCybereason closed a $25 million Series B funding round in May 2015, and quickly followed that with a $59 million Series C funding round in October 2015. Overall, the company has raised more than $88 million in funding.","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/how-apt32-hacked-global-asian-firm-persistence"},{"Unnamed: 0":2,"query":"APT32","text":"\"OceanLotus\" Spies Use New Backdoor in Recent Attacks\r\n\nOceanLotus, a cyber-espionage group believed to be operating out of Vietnam, has been using a new backdoor in recently observed attacks, but also using previously established tactics, ESET reveals.\nAlso known as APT32 and APT-C-00, the advanced persistent threat (APT) has been targeting high-profile corporate and government organizations in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. The group is well-resourced and determined and is known to be using custom-built malware in combination with techniques long known to be successful.\nOne of the latest malware families used by the group is a fully-fledged backdoor that provides operators with remote access to compromised machines, along with the ability to manipulate files, registries, and processes, as well as the option to load additional components if needed.\nFor distribution purposes, OceanLotus uses a two-stage attack that employs a dropper to gain initial foothold on the targeted system and prepare the stage for the backdoor, ESET explains in a new report (PDF).\nSpear-phishing emails are used to lure victims into opening an attachment that uses a fake icon to load password-protected decoy document while the malicious dropper is executed in the background.\nFake installers posing as updates for popular applications are also used, as part of watering hole attacks, where websites that the victims are likely to visit are compromised.\nThe dropper package includes components executed in a number of stages involving heavy code obfuscation to prevent detection. The malware authors also included garbage code in the dropper, for similar purposes.\nTo achieve persistence, the dropper creates a Windows service if administrator privileges are available, or modifies the operating system\u2019s registry if executed with normal privileges. Code designed to delete the lure document is also dropped onto the system.\nA digitally-signed Symantec executable (rastlsc.exe) is also dropped, along with a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named rastls.dll (detected as Win32\/Salgorea.BD). The signed executable loads the malicious DLL, which makes the malicious behavior look legitimate, a technique (called DLL side-loading) that has been abused before.\nThe backdoor supports over 23 commands to: fingerprint the system; read a file or registry key; create a process; create a file, a registry entry or a stream in memory; write to or query the registry; search for files on the system; move files to directories or delete them from disk; list the drives mapped to the system; create or delete directories; call the PE Loader; drop and execute a program; run shellcode in a new thread, and more.\n\u201cOnce again, OceanLotus shows that the team is active and continues to update its toolset. This also demonstrates its intention to remain hidden by picking its targets, limiting the distribution of their malware and using several different servers to avoid attracting attention to a single domain or IP address. The encryption of the payload, together with the side-loading technique \u2013 despite its age \u2013 is a good way to stay under the radar, since the malicious activities look like they come from the legitimate application,\u201d ESET concludes.\nRelated: Vietnamese Spies Rival Notorious Russian Group in Sophistication\nRelated: How APT32 Hacked a Global Asian Firm With Persistence","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/oceanlotus-spies-use-new-backdoor-recent-attacks"},{"Unnamed: 0":3,"query":"APT32","text":"Campaign Targets Russian-Speaking Enterprises With New Backdoor\r\n\nA malicious email campaign that has been active for at least two months is targeting Russian-speaking enterprises and delivering a new Windows-based backdoor, Trend Micro warns.\nThe attack relies on a variety of exploits and Windows components to run malicious scripts in an attempt to make detection and blocking more challenging. The earliest sample associated with the attack was uploaded to VirusTotal on June 6, 2017 and Trend Micro observed five spam runs from June 23 to July 27, 2017. The campaign is believed to be ongoing.\nTargets in this attack included financial institutions (such as banks) and mining firms. Trend Micro's researchers noticed that the attackers have diversified their tactics by sending different, targeted emails for each run. Because of the emails\u2019 limited distribution and specificity in social engineering lures, they should be considered part of a spear-phishing campaign, Trend Micro says.\nThe emails look as if they come from sales and billing departments and contain a malformed Rich Text Format (RTF) file that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) in Microsoft Office\u2019s Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface that was patched in April (the flaw is still being abused by threat actors such as Cobalt and CopyKittens).\nOnce the exploit code was executed, it downloads a fake XLS file embedded with malicious JavaScript. When opened, the Excel header is ignored and the file is treated as an HTML Application file by the Windows component mshta.exe.\nThe JavaScript code calls the odbcconf.exe normal executable, which performs various tasks associated with Microsoft Data Access Components, to run the DLL. Once executed, the DLL drops a file in the %APPDATA% folder and appends the .TXT extension to it, although this is an SCT file (Windows scriptlet) normally used to declare variables, define expressions, and add functional codes in web pages, but packed with malicious, obfuscated JavaScript as part of this attack.\nThe DLL calls the Regsvr32 (Microsoft Register Server) command-line utility to execute with specific parameters. Called Squiblydoo, this attack method abuses Regsvr32 to bypass restrictions on running scripts and evade application whitelisting protections such as AppLocker, and was previously associated with the activities of Vietnamese hacking group APT32.\n\u201cWhile Squiblydoo is already a known attack vector, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen it combined with odbcconf.exe,\u201d Trend Micro notes.\nNext, another XML file is executed, after being downloaded from the domain\u00a0wecloud[.]biz. This is the main backdoor used in this attack, which is executed using the same Regsvr32-abusing Squiblydoo attack technique.\nThe backdoor is a SCT file with obfuscated JavaScript code inside and supports commands that \u201cessentially allow attackers to take over an infected system.\u201d The backdoor attempts to connect to the command and control (C&C) server at hxxps:\/\/wecloud[.]biz\/mail\/ajax[.]php and retrieve tasks.\nBased on the received commands, the malware can download and execute Portable Executable (PE) files, delete files\/startup entries and terminate, download additional\/new scripts, run new script and terminate current script, or run command shell commands.\n\u201cWhile the later stages of the infection chain required the use of various Windows components, the entry point still involves the use of a Microsoft Office exploit. Patching and keeping software up-to-date will protect users. Alternately, employing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, virtual patching, and URL categorization, as well as enforcing robust patch management policies, will significantly reduce the system\u2019s attack surface,\u201d Trend Micro notes.\nRelated: Cobalt Hackers Now Using Supply Chain Attacks\nRelated: Iranian 'CopyKittens' Conduct Foreign Espionage\u00a0","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/campaign-targets-russian-speaking-enterprises-new-backdoor"},{"Unnamed: 0":4,"query":"APT32","text":"Vietnamese Spies Rival Notorious Russian Group in Sophistication\r\n\nThe campaigns of a cyber espionage group believed to be operating out of Vietnam have become increasingly sophisticated, up to the point where they rival operations launched by the notorious Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as Turla, incident response firm Volexity said on Monday.\nThe group, tracked as OceanLotus and APT32, has been around since at least 2012, targeting various types of organizations in Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Philippines and China, with some campaigns extending to Europe and the United States. The list of targeted entities includes governments, journalists, activists, tech firms, consumer product manufacturers, banks, and organizations in the hospitality sector.\nOceanLotus has used both Windows and Mac malware in its operations, along with some clever techniques that have allowed the group to evade detection.\nVolexity has been tracking the threat actor since May 2017, specifically attacks aimed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and media, human rights, and civil society organizations. The security firm agrees with FireEye\u2019s previous assessment that OceanLotus is likely based in Vietnam.\n\u201cVolexity believes the size and scale of this attack campaign have only previously been rivaled by a Russian APT group commonly referred to as Turla,\u201d the security firm said in a blog post.\nVolexity\u2019s analysis showed that OceanLotus\u2019s watering hole attacks involved more than 100 compromised websites belonging to government, military, media, civil society, human rights and oil exploitation entities.\nResearchers determined that the group\u2019s attacks are highly targeted; the compromised sites served malicious code only to visitors who were on a whitelist. Targeted users are shown a fake screen designed to trick them into authorizing a malicious Google app that could access the victim\u2019s emails and contacts. Some of the compromised websites were also set up to deliver backdoors and other types of tools, including legitimate software (e.g. Cobalt Strike) and custom malware.\nResearchers also noticed that the attackers created many fake domains designed to mimic legitimate services such as AddThis, Akamai, Baidu, Cloudflare, Disqus, Facebook and Google. Many of these websites leveraged SSL certificates provided by Let\u2019s Encrypt, whose services have been increasingly abused by cybercriminals.\n\u201cVolexity believes the OceanLotus threat group has rapidly advanced its capabilities and is now one of the more sophisticated APT actors currently in operation,\u201d the company concluded.\nOceanLotus\u2019 sophistication was also described recently in a report from Cybereason, which detailed the group\u2019s cat-and-mouse games within the systems of a global company operating in Asia.\nRelated: Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank Victim of SWIFT-based Attack\nRelated: Second SWIFT Attack Hits Vietnam Bank Showing Links to Sony Hack","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/vietnamese-spies-rival-notorious-russian-group-sophistication"},{"Unnamed: 0":5,"query":"APT32","text":"New macOS Backdoor Linked to Cyber-espionage Group\r\n\nA recently discovered macOS backdoor is believed to be a new version of malware previously associated with the OceanLotus cyber-espionage group, Trend Micro says.\nAlso known as APT 32, APT-C-00, SeaLotus, and Cobalt Kitty, OceanLotus is\u00a0believed to be operating out of Vietnam and  has been targeting high-profile corporate and government organizations in Southeast Asia. Well-resourced and determined, the group uses custom-built malware and already established techniques.\nSome of the group\u2019s targets include human rights organizations, media organizations, research institutes, and maritime construction firms.\nThe newly discovered macOS backdoor, which Trend Micro detects as OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D, has been observed on machines that have the Perl programming language installed.\nThe malware is being distributed via malicious documents attached to emails. The document masquerades as the registration form for an event with HDMC, an organization in Vietnam that advertises national independence and democracy.\nThe document contains malicious, obfuscated macros with a payload written in Perl. The macro extracts an XML file from the Word document. This file is an executable acting as the dropper for the final payload, which is the backdoor.\nThe dropper, which has all of its strings encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256 key, is also used to establish the backdoor\u2019s persistence on the infected systems. The dropper checks whether it runs as root or not, and uses different path and filename based on that.\nThe dropper sets the backdoor\u2019s attributes to \u201chidden\u201d and uses random values for the file date and time, and deletes itself at the end of the process.\nThe backdoor has two main functions, which collect platform information and sending it to the command and control (C&C) server. It can also receive additional C&C communication information, which is encrypted before being sent.\n\u201cMalicious attacks targeting Mac devices are not as common as its counterparts, but the discovery of this new macOS backdoor that is presumably distributed via phishing email calls for every user to adopt best practices for phishing attacks regardless of operating system,\u201d Trend Micro concludes.\nRelated: \"OceanLotus\" Spies Use New Backdoor in Recent Attacks\nRelated: Vietnamese Spies Rival Notorious Russian Group in Sophistication","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/new-macos-backdoor-linked-cyber-espionage-group"},{"Unnamed: 0":6,"query":"APT32","text":"Breaches Increasingly Discovered Internally: Mandiant\r\n\nOrganizations are getting increasingly better at discovering data breaches on their own, with more than 60% of intrusions in 2017 detected internally, according to FireEye-owned Mandiant.\nThe company\u2019s M-Trends report for 2018 shows that the global median time for internal detection dropped to 57.5 days in 2017, compared to 80 days in the previous year. Of the total number of breaches investigated by Mandiant last year, 62% were discovered internally, up from 53% in 2016.\nOn the other hand, it still took roughly the same amount of time for organizations to learn that their systems had been compromised. The global median dwell time in 2017 \u2013 the median time from the first evidence of a hack to detection \u2013 was 101 days, compared to 99 days in 2016.\nCompanies in the Americas had the shortest median dwell time (75.5 days), while organizations in the APAC region had the longest dwell time (nearly 500 days).\n\nData collected by Mandiant in 2013 showed that more than one-third of organizations had been attacked again after the initial incident had been remediated. More recent data, specifically from the past 19 months, showed that 56% of Mandiant customers were targeted again by either the same group or one with similar motivation.\nIn cases where investigators discovered at least one type of significant activity (e.g. compromised accounts, data theft, lateral movement), the targeted organization was successfully attacked again within one year.
