[{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT18","text":"Chinese Cyberspies Target European Drone Maker, Energy Firm\r\n\nAn advanced persistent threat (APT) actor believed to be based in China has been spotted targeting the systems of a European drone maker and a U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company.\nThreat intelligence firm ThreatConnect has analyzed the attacks, but could not precisely determine which group is behind the campaign. The main suspects are Emissary Panda, also known as APT27 and TG-3390, and Dynamite Panda, also known as APT18, Wekby and TG-0416. It\u2019s unclear if the hackers managed to steal any data from the targeted organizations.\nAnalysis of the attacks started in June, when ThreatConnect came across a variant of the HttpBrowser backdoor, which has been leveraged by both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda.\nThe domain used by the malware for command and control (C&C) communications is adobesys[dot]com. The email address that registered this domain at a Chinese domain reseller was previously used to register domains involved in the Anthem and OPM attacks, both of which have been attributed to China.\nResearchers pointed out that both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda have targeted the defense and aerospace industries, but only the former is known to attack organizations in the energy sector.\nIn September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, agreed not to conduct cyber espionage for economic gain. The agreement has had some impact, but espionage operations launched from China have not ceased. FireEye reported in June that Chinese spying had dropped in volume and became more focused.\nThe subsidiary of the French energy management firm targeted in the attacks observed by ThreatConnect has been contracted by the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense. While targeting an energy company could constitute a violation of the September 2015 agreement, experts believe China could argue that this is in fact military espionage.\nIn the case of the targeted drone manufacturer, that is more likely to be an economically motivated attack. Researchers pointed out that China\u2019s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI) is one of the world\u2019s largest drone makers and currently holds roughly 70 percent of the market share. Targeting a European competitor can help the company maintain its position as a leader in this sector.\n\u201cWhile Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn\u2019t ended and likely has evolved to help solidify leading market shares. In some ways, solidifying the dominant Chinese firm in a market feels like the next chapter in economic espionage. The overarching storyline of China\u2019s economic espionage has been targeting strategic industries and allowing China to catch up with established champions,\u201d ThreatConnect explained.\n\u201cChina may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations that are headquartered elsewhere. Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more efficient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple intelligence requirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity as non-economic espionage, thereby adhering (with their fingers crossed) to the Rose Garden agreement,\u201d the company added.\nRelated Reading: False Flags and Mis-Direction in Hacker Attribution\nRelated Reading: \"Wekby\" Group Uses DNS Requests for C&C Communications\nRelated Reading: China Cybergang Using Hacking Team Exploits Against Financial Firm","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/chinese-cyberspies-target-european-drone-maker-energy-firm"},{"Unnamed: 0":1,"query":"APT18","text":"Chinese APT Group Uses Hacking Team\u2019s Flash Player Exploit\r\n\nThe Adobe Flash Player exploit stolen by hackers from spyware maker Hacking Team has been leveraged by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, according to security solutions provider Volexity.\nOne of the groups observed leveraging CVE-2015-5119, which Adobe patched on Wednesday morning, is known as Wekby, APT 18, Dynamite Panda and TG-0416. The threat group, believed to have Chinese roots, is the main suspect in last year\u2019s attack on Community Health Systems. Attackers stole 4.5 million patient records from the organization, reportedly by exploiting the OpenSSL vulnerability dubbed Heartbleed.\nAccording to Volexity, Wekby launched a spear phishing campaign involving emails titled \u201cImportant: Flash update\u201d just as Adobe was getting ready to patch the Flash Player zero-day.\nThe emails were sent out using a spoofed Adobe email address and they contained a link apparently pointing to the official Adobe download domain. Users who clicked on the link were taken to a website set up to serve a malicious SWF file designed to exploit the Flash Player vulnerability in order to deliver a piece of malware.\nThe malware, in this case the Gh0st remote access Trojan (RAT), communicates with a Singapore IP address that has served as a command and control (C&C) server in many of Wekby\u2019s attacks over the past years.\nLabels spotted by researchers in the malicious SWF file suggest that Hacking Team is the source of the exploit.\nVolexity says the Flash Player exploit has been leveraged in multiple APT and non-APT attacks.\nHackers leaked a total of 400GB of data stolen from Hacking Team, including surveillance software, source code and exploits. The Flash Player exploit was integrated into exploit kits before Adobe managed to patch the vulnerability. Trend Micro reported that the Flash flaw was exploited before the Hacking Team breach came to light in attacks apparently aimed at users in Korea.\nAs far as Wekby is concerned, Volexity is not the only security firm to analyze the group\u2019s activities recently. ThreatStream issued a report on Monday detailing some of the evasive maneuvers used by the threat actor.\nResearchers discovered that the group has been using variants of the HTTPBrowser tool that uses DNS as a covert channel for communications. Experts also noticed that the APT actor has been trying to complicate the analysis of their malware by using return-oriented programming (ROP) to control execution flow.","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/chinese-apt-group-uses-hacking-team%E2%80%99s-flash-player-exploit"},{"Unnamed: 0":2,"query":"APT18","text":"Two New Flash Player Zero-Day Bugs Found in Hacking Team Leak\r\n\nResearchers have identified exploits for two new Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerabilities in the Hacking Team leak. Adobe has promised to patch the newly discovered bugs sometime this week.\nLast week, several security firms reported finding zero-day exploits for Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) and Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities in the 400GB of data stolen by hackers from the systems of Italy-based spyware maker Hacking Team. Shortly after Adobe released an update to address the Flash Player bug, researchers reported finding two additional Flash exploits in the leaked data.\nOne of the new Flash Player zero-days (CVE-2015-5122), involving the opaqueBackground property of the DisplayObject class in ActionScript 3, was reported to Adobe by FireEye. The security company noted that the proof-of-concept (PoC) code for this use-after-free (UAF) flaw was likely written by the author of the PoC for CVE-2015-5119.\nThe second unpatched UAF vulnerability (CVE-2015-5123) is related to the ActionScript 3 BitmapData object. The issue was reported to Adobe by Trend Micro and the security researcher known online as \u201cslipstream\/RoL\u201d (@TheWack0lian).\nBoth of these vulnerabilities affect Flash Player 18.0.0.204 and earlier, and they allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. According to an advisory published by Adobe over the weekend, patches for these bugs will be made available in the week of July 12.\nThe security researcher known as Kafeine reported that the Angler exploit kit has been leveraging CVE-2015-5122 since Saturday. Other exploit kits will likely follow soon.\nThe first Flash Player vulnerability whose existence came to light following the Hacking Team breach was integrated into several exploit kits. The flaw was also leveraged by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors such as Wekby (APT 18) and UPS (APT3) in their operations.\nIn a statement published last week, Hacking Team said it was concerned that the code published by hackers allows anyone to deploy the company\u2019s surveillance software.\n\u201cBefore the attack, HackingTeam could control who had access to the technology which was sold exclusively to governments and government agencies. Now, because of the work of criminals, that ability to control who uses the technology has been lost. Terrorists, extortionists and others can deploy this technology at will if they have the technical ability to do so,\u201d Hacking Team said. \u201cWe believe this is an extremely dangerous situation.\u201d\nDespite numerous accusations that it sold its solutions to totalitarian governments, the Italian company has denied doing anything illegal. However, the data leaked as a result of the breach appears to show that the company was well aware that its products had been used in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.\nMarietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, has asked the European Commission and Italian authorities to investigate Hacking Team\u2019s activities.\nRelated: Hacking Team\u2019s Flash Player Zero-Day Spotted in Attacks Prior to Breach","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/two-new-flash-player-zero-day-bugs-found-hacking-team-leak"},{"Unnamed: 0":3,"query":"APT18","text":"\"Wekby\" Group Uses DNS Requests for C&C Communications\r\n\nPalo Alto Networks researchers noticed that a China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been using a piece of malware that leverages DNS requests for command and control (C&C) communications.\nThe group, known as Wekby, APT 18, Dynamite Panda and TG-0416, is believed to be responsible for the 2014 attack on Community Health Systems, one of the largest hospital operators in the United States. In that operation, the attackers reportedly stole 4.5 million patient records by exploiting the OpenSSL vulnerability dubbed Heartbleed.\nThe group is known to quickly add new exploits to its arsenal. One example is a Flash Player exploit that the actor started using shortly after it was leaked last year from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team.\nIn a more recent attack aimed at a US-based organization, Wekby leveraged a piece of malware dubbed by Palo Alto Networks \u201cpisloader.\u201d Based on metadata and the commands it uses, researchers believe pisloader is a variant of HTTPBrowser, a remote access Trojan (RAT) known to be used by Wekby and other APT actors.\nThe attackers delivered the malware using an infrastructure that includes domains made to look like they belong to major organizations such as Logitech and Global Print.\nThe hackers first deliver a dropper designed to add registry keys for persistence, and decrypt and execute a file that contains the pisloader payload. The payload is obfuscated using a ROP technique and contains random assembly instructions to make reverse engineering more difficult.\nPisloader uses DNS requests for C&C communications, which allows it to bypass certain security products that don\u2019t properly inspect this type of traffic.\nAn increasing number of threats have been leveraging the technique, including point-of-sale (PoS) malware such as FrameworkPOS and Multigrain.\nIn the case of pisloader, the malware periodically sends a DNS beacon request to its C&C server, whose location is hardcoded into the malware. The DNS responses must meet certain requirements, otherwise the malware will ignore them.\nThe server responds with a TXT record that can contain various commands for the malware, including to collect system information, list file information for a specified directory, upload a file to the infected machine, and launch a command shell.\nThe commands are similar to the ones used by HTTPBrowser, which, researchers said last year, was also using DNS as a covert communications channel.\nRelated: Microsoft Office Flaw Exploited by Several APT Actors","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/wekby-group-uses-dns-requests-cc-communications"}]
