ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxps Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account. NSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity7. From their latest post, which contains GAOs Uber receipts, it is clear the groups information likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data. In addition, FalconIntelligence notes that following the late 2015 Sino-U.S. brief cyber detente, much of the responsibility for western cyber intrusion operations was handed to the MSS as the PLA underwent an extensive reform that is still currently underway, and which is consolidating its military cyber forces under the Strategic Support Force. Many of these adversaries have begun targeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of data.

ZHANG Shilong ()
ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxps Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account. From there, a trail of overlapping registrant details reveals ZHANGs hanzi characters for his name (), likely one of his personal home addresses, potential work addresses and several email addresses:

long@xiaohong[. ]org
baobei@xiaohong[. ]org
atreexp@yahoo[. ]com.cn 
robin4700@foxmail[. ]com
eshilong@vip.qq[. As the IntrusionTruth blog post mentions, it is a registered firm with two listed representatives, Fang Ting () and Sun Lei (), and a listed address of 1906 Fuyu Mansion (1-1906). This is interesting considering STONE PANDAs extensive targeting of Japanese defense firms after this time period, but it is by no means conclusive evidence that the firm is connected to STONE PANDA. NSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity7. From their latest post, which contains GAOs Uber receipts, it is clear the groups information likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data.

Many of these adversaries have begun targeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of data. As such, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence assesses that although Boyusec may have shuttered, elements of GOTHIC PANDA are likely to still be active.

We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10.

APT10 Background  APT10 (MenuPass Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009. We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. Further collaboration between FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered additional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target. APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer. (For more information on infection via service providers see M-Trends 2016 ). Service providers have significant access to customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to move laterally into the network of the service providers customer. In addition, web traffic between a service providers customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as benign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data stealthily. We believe the pace of APT10 operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog ; however, we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.

China-linked APT10 Hackers Update Attack Techniques

Recently attacks launched by the China-linked threat actor APT10 against the Japanese media sector revealed the use of updated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), FireEye says. Last year, the group targeted entities in at least fourteen countries, including the website of a prominent U.S. trade association. Known in the security community as ANEL, the malware was apparently in pre-release form (beta or release candidate) until recently, FireEyes security researchers say. The latest version also features randomized exported function names and was observed sending an error code in the Cookie header when failing to receive the HTTP response from the command and control (C&C) server.

China-Linked Group Uses New Malware in Japan Attacks

A China-linked threat actor has been using a new Trojan in attacks aimed at individuals and organizations located in or with ties to Japan, Palo Alto Networks reported on Thursday. The attacks started with spear-phishing emails that came from spoofed addresses, including of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the White House. ChChes was disguised as a Word document and it was signed using a certificate from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. In addition to collecting information about the infected system, ChChes has modules that help it encrypt communications, execute shell commands, upload and download files, and load and execute DLLs, according to an analysis conducted by Japans Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC).

As always with such reports, attribution is down to the weight of circumstantial evidence. It is MSPs in all of those countries that are the targets; and we are not told of any specific client organizations breached. The two accords specify 'economic espionage'; political espionage is still acceptable in both directions. "Overall," comments Israel Barak, CISO of Cybereason, "the notion that China has decreased its efforts since 2015 to conduct economic espionage is preposterous. To reiterate, it is too early in this particular instance to determine whether the Cameron-Xi accord was broken or is it simply a case of competitive intelligence and cybercrime that must be dealt with bilaterally between Great Britain and China."

As always with such reports, attribution is down to the weight of circumstantial evidence. From here they obtain legitimate credentials to access the MSPs' client networks that align to APT10's targeting profile -- which the authors claim aligns with China's current five-year plan (FYP) for economic growth. "It is fundamental for organizations to come to terms with the fact that raising their own security posture is essential but not sufficient," warns Donato Capitella, senior security consultant at MWR InfoSecurity; "especially if they are then willing to interweave their IT systems with third parties whose security posture is insufficient.

The attacks leveraged an AppLocker bypass that was publicly revealed last year, as well as fileless execution and persistence, and benign documents to minimize user suspicion of malicious activity. This technique was demonstrated last year to effectively bypass AppLocker, the Microsoft application whitelisting solution that prevents unknown executables from running on a system. In this campaign, the malicious SCT file was designed to invoke WScript to launch PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command, FireEye reports. A fourth stage PowerShell script in the HKCU\Console\FontSecurity registry borrows from the publicly available Inject-LocalShellCode script from PowerSploit to inject shellcode, researchers explain. The decrypted shellcode also revealed content and configuration related to Poison Ivy.

The use of MSP increases an organizations virtual enterprise infrastructure footprint, but also creates a large attack surface for cyber criminals and nation-state actors, DHS United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) points out. The newly released alert, TA18-276B, is related to activity that DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) warned about in April 2017. Tracked since 2009, the group has historically targeted mainly Japanese entities. Last year, the group was observed targeting entities in at least fourteen countries, including the website of a prominent U.S. trade association. These include restricting access to networks and systems, using a dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN) for MSP connection, using firewalls, implement best practices for password and permission management, and incorporate operational controls.

Once inside the network, they typically use custom backdoor malware to achieve lateral movement, data exfiltration and persistence. For example, Tick uses a variety of methods to gain access to victim networks, such as spearphishing, watering hole attacks and software exploitations including a zero-day vulnerability to access company networks.
