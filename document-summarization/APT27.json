[{"Unnamed: 0":0,"query":"APT27","text":"Chinese Cyberspies Target European Drone Maker, Energy Firm\r\n\nAn advanced persistent threat (APT) actor believed to be based in China has been spotted targeting the systems of a European drone maker and a U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company.\nThreat intelligence firm ThreatConnect has analyzed the attacks, but could not precisely determine which group is behind the campaign. The main suspects are Emissary Panda, also known as APT27 and TG-3390, and Dynamite Panda, also known as APT18, Wekby and TG-0416. It\u2019s unclear if the hackers managed to steal any data from the targeted organizations.\nAnalysis of the attacks started in June, when ThreatConnect came across a variant of the HttpBrowser backdoor, which has been leveraged by both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda.\nThe domain used by the malware for command and control (C&C) communications is adobesys[dot]com. The email address that registered this domain at a Chinese domain reseller was previously used to register domains involved in the Anthem and OPM attacks, both of which have been attributed to China.\nResearchers pointed out that both Emissary Panda and Dynamite Panda have targeted the defense and aerospace industries, but only the former is known to attack organizations in the energy sector.\nIn September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, agreed not to conduct cyber espionage for economic gain. The agreement has had some impact, but espionage operations launched from China have not ceased. FireEye reported in June that Chinese spying had dropped in volume and became more focused.\nThe subsidiary of the French energy management firm targeted in the attacks observed by ThreatConnect has been contracted by the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense. While targeting an energy company could constitute a violation of the September 2015 agreement, experts believe China could argue that this is in fact military espionage.\nIn the case of the targeted drone manufacturer, that is more likely to be an economically motivated attack. Researchers pointed out that China\u2019s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI) is one of the world\u2019s largest drone makers and currently holds roughly 70 percent of the market share. Targeting a European competitor can help the company maintain its position as a leader in this sector.\n\u201cWhile Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn\u2019t ended and likely has evolved to help solidify leading market shares. In some ways, solidifying the dominant Chinese firm in a market feels like the next chapter in economic espionage. The overarching storyline of China\u2019s economic espionage has been targeting strategic industries and allowing China to catch up with established champions,\u201d ThreatConnect explained.\n\u201cChina may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations that are headquartered elsewhere. Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more efficient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple intelligence requirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity as non-economic espionage, thereby adhering (with their fingers crossed) to the Rose Garden agreement,\u201d the company added.\nRelated Reading: False Flags and Mis-Direction in Hacker Attribution\nRelated Reading: \"Wekby\" Group Uses DNS Requests for C&C Communications\nRelated Reading: China Cybergang Using Hacking Team Exploits Against Financial Firm","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/chinese-cyberspies-target-european-drone-maker-energy-firm"},{"Unnamed: 0":1,"query":"APT27","text":"Chinese Cyberspies Target National Data Center in Asia\r\n\nA China-linked cyber espionage group has targeted a national data center in Central Asia and experts believe the goal is to conduct watering hole attacks on the country\u2019s government websites.\nThe threat actor is tracked as LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27 and Threat Group 3390. The group has been active since at least 2010, targeting hundreds of organizations around the world, including U.S. defense contractors, financial services firms, a European drone maker, and the U.S.-based subsidiary of a French energy management company.\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab recently identified a new attack carried out by this actor. The security firm spotted the campaign in March 2018, but believes it was launched in the fall of 2017.\nThe attack targeted a national data center in an unnamed country in Central Asia. Researchers say the goal is likely to inject malicious JavaScript code into the government websites connected to the data center in order to conduct watering hole attacks.\nWhen accessed, the compromised government websites served either the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF), a penetration testing suite that focuses on the web browser, or the ScanBox reconnaissance framework.\nKaspersky has not been able to determine how the national data center was breached, but believes the hackers may have used watering hole attacks aimed at the organization\u2019s employees or through weaponized Office documents \u2013 the threat group has been spotted using CVE-2017-11882.\nThe attack involved a piece of malware tracked by Kaspersky as HyperBro, a RAT that has been used by several Chinese-speaking threat actors. The samples analyzed by Kaspersky had timestamps ranging from December 2017 to January 2018, with evidence found by experts suggesting that the malware had made its way to the data center sometime in mid-November 2017.\nThe main command and control (C&C) server used in this campaign is hosted on an IP address associated with a Ukrainian ISP. Specifically, the IP belongs to a MikroTik router running a firmware version released in March 2016.\n\u201cA national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites,\u201d Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post. \u201cAnother interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. The reasons for this are not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don\u2019t bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.\u201d\nRelated: China-Linked Spies Used New Malware in U.K. Government Attack\nRelated: Researchers Link Several State-Sponsored Chinese Spy Groups","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/chinese-cyberspies-target-national-data-center-asia"},{"Unnamed: 0":2,"query":"APT27","text":"China-linked Hackers Use Signed Network Filtering Driver in Recent Attacks\r\n\nA cyber-espionage group believed to be operating out of China has been using a digitally signed network filtering driver as part of recent attacks, Kaspersky Lab reports.\nTracked as LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27 and Threat Group 3390, the actor has been active since at least 2010, hitting hundreds of organizations worldwide (U.S. defense contractors, financial services firms, a European drone maker, and a national data center in Central Asia, among others).\nOver the past several months, the actor has been abusing the digitally signed 32- and 64-bit network filtering driver NDISProxy to inject a previously unknown Trojan into the lsass.exe system process memory.\nThe most interesting aspect of the incidents, however, was that the driver was signed with a digital certificate belonging to Shenzhen, Guangdong-based information security software developer LeagSoft. The company was notified of the certificate abuse.\nHighly targeted at Middle Asian government entities, Kaspersky is confident that LuckyMouse is behind it.\nAs part of the campaign, the actor used a dropper supposedly distributed through networks that were already compromised, and not through spear-phishing emails. The executable files can install both 32-bit and 64-bit drivers, depending on the target, and log all installation process steps.\nThe installer sets an autorun Windows service running NDISProxy and achieves persistency, and also adds the encrypted in-memory Trojan to the system registry. The network filtering driver decrypts and injects the Trojan into memory and filters port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP) traffic to inject the command and control (C&C) communication into it.\nThe final payload in the attack is a C++ Trojan that works as an HTTPS server and which waits passively for communications from the C&C.\nThese three modules (installer, driver, and Trojan) allow attackers to silently move laterally across infected infrastructure. However, because no communication with the C&C is available if the infected host only has a LAN IP, the Earthworm SOCKS tunneler is used to connect the LAN of the infected host to the external C&C server.\n\u201cThey also used the Scanline network scanner to find file shares (port 135, Server Message Block, SMB) which they use to spread malware with administrative passwords, compromised with keyloggers,\u201d Kaspersky reveals.\nThe injected Trojan is a full-featured RAT that can execute common tasks onto the compromised machine, including running commands and downloading\/uploading files. The malware is used for data harvesting, lateral movement, and for the creation of SOCKS tunnels to the C&C.\nThe use of the publicly-available Earthworm tunneler is common to Chinese-speaking actors and one of the commands used by the attackers creates a tunnel to a previously known LuckyMouse server, which, paired with the choice of victims in this campaign, suggests that this actor is behind the attacks, Kaspersky says.\n\u201cWe have observed a gradual shift in several Chinese-speaking campaigns towards a combination of publicly available tools (such as Metasploit or CobaltStrike) and custom malware (like the C++ last stage RAT described in this report). We have also observed how different actors adopt code from GitHub repositories on a regular basis. All this combines to make attribution more difficult,\u201d Kaspersky concludes.\nRelated: Chinese Cyberspies Target National Data Center in Asia","url":"https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/china-linked-hackers-use-signed-network-filtering-driver-recent-attacks"}]
