Unlike many of the other nation-state actors that CrowdStrike monitors, COZY BEAR tends to cast a wide net, sending out thousands of phishing emails to a broad set of targets. This is notable, as most nation-state attackers tracked by CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence prefer to conduct more focused operations against smaller sets of targets. In terms of post-exploitation operations, COZY BEAR is aggressive, using the latest components of the target operating system to hide from antivirus and host-based security tools. To learn more about using threat intelligence to defend your enterprise, protect your endpoints and proactively hunt sophisticated threat actors, visit the CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence page.

APT29 Cyberspies Use Domain Fronting to Evade Detection

The Russia-linked cyber espionage group known as APT29 has been using a technique called domain fronting in an effort to make it more difficult for targeted organizations to identify malicious traffic, FireEye reported on Monday. Open Whisper Systems recently implemented the technique to help Signal users in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates bypass government censorship. The group is believed to be behind the recent election-related attacks in the U.S. and a campaign targeting high-profile organizations in Norway.

A group of sophisticated hackers from Russia are using a malware tool that helps them hide Malicious activity within legitimate network traffic by leveraging common web services such as Twitter, GitHub and cloud storage providers, FireEye said Wednesday. FireEye researchers explained that the malware communication process used by HAMMERTOSS could be broken down into several stages to explain how the tool operates, receives instructions, and extracts information from a victims network. The first stage leverages Twitter, and utilizes specific accounts that are created by a predictable algorithm and changed daily.

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file, FireEyes report explained. The APT29 attackers are suspected by FireEye to be a Russian APT group, and also believed to be connected to MiniDuke and OnionDuke attack campaigns. We speculate that APT29 may make modifications to HAMMERTOSS or abandon it altogether and develop a new tool if they discover incident responders or antivirus software is detecting it, FireEyes report concluded.

Norway Accuses Russia of Cyberattack

Oslo - Norway's foreign ministry, army and other institutions were targeted in a recent cyberattack by a group suspected of ties to Russian authorities, Norwegian intelligence -- which was among the targets -- said Friday. Known as APT 29, the group singled out by Oslo has already been accused of hacking interference in the US election last year. "Nine different email accounts were targeted in an attempt at what is called spear phishing, in other words malicious emails," Arne Christian Haugstoyl, an official with Norway's intelligence service PST, told television channel TV2. PST spokesman Martin Bernsen, quoted by daily Verdens Gang (VG), said there was "no reason to believe that classified information had been obtained in connection with the attack." The Scandinavian country on Wednesday summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest after Moscow refused visas to two senior lawmakers in a move Oslo denounced as "unjustifiable".

Early Toolsets Used by "Dukes" Attackers Suggest Russian Roots

A new report published last week by F-Secure details the activities of the threat group behind the notorious Duke malware family, and points to the numerous clues suggesting that the actor is sponsored by the Russian government. Researchers believe the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor behind these threats, dubbed the Dukes and APT29, has been active since at least 2008. The group has mainly focused on Western government institutions, political think tanks, government contractors, and other organizations that possess information related to foreign and security policy decisions. The GeminiDuke toolset was mainly designed for collecting information on the infected computers configuration. Based on the length of the Dukes activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in the operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group to have significant and most critically, stable financial backing.

Espionage operations involving threats such as CosmicDuke, MiniDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke (CozyBear/CozyCar), SeaDuke and CloudDuke have been analyzed by several security firms over the past years. Researchers believe the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor behind these threats, dubbed the Dukes and APT29, has been active since at least 2008. The group has mainly focused on Western government institutions, political think tanks, government contractors, and other organizations that possess information related to foreign and security policy decisions.

Based on the length of the Dukes activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in the operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group to have significant and most critically, stable financial backing. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-profile targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes, F-Secure explained in its report on the Dukes. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either within or directly for a government, thus ruling out the possibility of a criminal gang or another third party.
