ZHANG Shilong ()
ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxps Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account. NSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity7. From their latest post, which contains GAOs Uber receipts, it is clear the groups information likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data. In addition, FalconIntelligence notes that following the late 2015 Sino-U.S. brief cyber detente, much of the responsibility for western cyber intrusion operations was handed to the MSS as the PLA underwent an extensive reform that is still currently underway, and which is consolidating its military cyber forces under the Strategic Support Force. Many of these adversaries have begun targeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of data.

ZHANG Shilong ()
ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxps Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account. From there, a trail of overlapping registrant details reveals ZHANGs hanzi characters for his name (), likely one of his personal home addresses, potential work addresses and several email addresses:

long@xiaohong[. ]org
baobei@xiaohong[. ]org
atreexp@yahoo[. ]com.cn 
robin4700@foxmail[. ]com
eshilong@vip.qq[. As the IntrusionTruth blog post mentions, it is a registered firm with two listed representatives, Fang Ting () and Sun Lei (), and a listed address of 1906 Fuyu Mansion (1-1906). This is interesting considering STONE PANDAs extensive targeting of Japanese defense firms after this time period, but it is by no means conclusive evidence that the firm is connected to STONE PANDA. NSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity7. From their latest post, which contains GAOs Uber receipts, it is clear the groups information likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data. In addition, FalconIntelligence notes that following the late 2015 Sino-U.S. brief cyber detente, much of the responsibility for western cyber intrusion operations was handed to the MSS as the PLA underwent an extensive reform that is still currently underway, and which is consolidating its military cyber forces under the Strategic Support Force. Many of these adversaries have begun targeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of data. As such, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence assesses that although Boyusec may have shuttered, elements of GOTHIC PANDA are likely to still be active.

The scale and impact of APT1s operations compelled us to write the report and release more than 3,000 Indicators to help organizations defend against APT1's tactics. However, we can confirm that APT1 continues cyber espionage operations against targeted computer networks. Since the report, APT1 has stopped using the vast majority of the infrastructure that was disclosed with the release of the indicators. The discovery and attribution of APT1 to China's 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department (Military Unit Cover Designator 61398) also elevated the public dialogue about cyber espionage and the theft of intellectual property to a level not seen before. The subject of Chinese attacks, such as those conducted by APT1, seems poised to stay front and center on the diplomatic agenda where, according to the New York Times , it will be a "central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama's national security adviser, Thomas Donilon."

A little over a year ago, Mandiant released a report that brought the term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) into the public conversation and made these types of targeted attacks top of mind for government and commercial organizations around the world. Recently, FireEye COO, Kevin Mandia took the stage at RSA USA 2014 to take a look back and share his perspective on the activities that led to the release of the APT1 report and the aftermath. While the initial report caused a media frenzy, unquestionably, the most important part of the story is the aftermath. Mandiant released the report to elevate the dialogue and address the frustration of organizations that were throwing money at cybersecurity problems and still facing attacks. Watch the video below for Kevins full speech and feel free to drop a comment below to continue the discussion.

This allows us to understand the actual attack surface and attacker tactics and to further hone our hunting and detection to address new attacks. Our assessment is that the total number of mobile malware existing in the wild is likely higher than currently reported, due to shortcomings in telemetry that makes these more difficult to spot and eradicate. While many have grown desensitized to the weight of these breaches, its important to understand that the release of PII at scale endangers a fundamental pillar of e-commerce and the bureaucratic convenience of adopting the Internet for important paperwork. Perhaps thus far resilient alternatives like ApplePay will come into vogue as de facto means of insuring identity and transactions, but in the meantime we may see a slowdown in the critical role of the Internet for modernizing tedious bureaucratic processes and cutting operational costs.

Our assessment is that the total number of mobile malware existing in the wild is likely higher than currently reported, due to shortcomings in telemetry that makes these more difficult to spot and eradicate. In 2018, we estimate that destructive attacks will continue to rise, leveraging its status as the most visible type of cyberwarfare. In March 2017, IoT encryption scheme proposals developed by the NSA came into question with Simon and Speck variant ISO approvals being both withdrawn and delayed a second time . While many have grown desensitized to the weight of these breaches, its important to understand that the release of PII at scale endangers a fundamental pillar of e-commerce and the bureaucratic convenience of adopting the Internet for important paperwork.

The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East. In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks  mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below. This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.

Two weeks later, Facebook issued a statement that the computers of several of the companys staff members had been infected by exploits during visits to a mobile developer site. (18.78%), an adware Trojan ranked second. Third and fourth place both went to SMS Trojans from the Opfake family: Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a (12.23%) and Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.bo (11.49%). It spread via unofficial Chinese app stores with popular, cracked games. To do so, the Trojans stealthily download and install apps on the victims mobile device, and then give that app the highest possible rating in the app store. Microsoft, Mozilla, and Google all revoked two root certificates issued by the certificate authority TurkTrust, thus removing them from their respective browser databases.

Far too often, a security vendor will report about how they uncovered a breach, but often lack the details that would help real infosec professionals to better do their job. But the point is rather that highly targeted phishing can be constructed to fool even savvy well-trained users, and we cant rely on training to solve the problem on its own. The report also shared that once the infection was established, the attackers would often rely on RDP (remote desktop protocol) to administer the ongoing attack.

Lessons from Mandiants APT1 Report

Last week Mandiant released a powerful report that exposed what certainly appears to be a state-sponsored hacking initiative from China, dubbed by Mandiant as APT1. In this article I will summarize some of the key indicators as well as some of the techniques that may help you find other indicators of advanced attacks in your network. 3,000 Indicators
It was certainly heartwarming to see Mandiant release a large number of very specific indicators of APT1 that security teams can put to good use. Far too often, a security vendor will report about how they uncovered a breach, but often lack the details that would help real infosec professionals to better do their job. In this report, Mandiant has done the industry a solid by disclosing a variety of very specific indicators that they have been able to tie to APT1, including domains used by the attacking infrastructure, SSL certificates used to encrypt the attackers traffic, MD5 hashes of APT1 malware and a variety of other open-source indicators of compromise. The indicators of compromise delve more deeply into the techniques of the attackers as opposed to certs and domain, which are effectively disposable. But the point is rather that highly targeted phishing can be constructed to fool even savvy well-trained users, and we cant rely on training to solve the problem on its own. Instead, we need to proactively test and analyze content to programmatically determine if it is malicious or benign. The report also shared that once the infection was established, the attackers would often rely on RDP (remote desktop protocol) to administer the ongoing attack. RDP has been strongly linked to advanced attacks shared in a variety of other reports, including this years Verizon Data Breach Report. Once it was time to steal data, the attackers predominantly relied on FTP.

Since the Mandiant report came out, we saw an immediate decrease in attacks, Charles Charlie Croom, VP of Cyber Strategy and Government Relations at Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions, told SecurityWeek. Were glad Mandiant stood up, Croom said. They will go to a supplier who has the connection to Lockheed Martin from an IT perspective, or even in a sharing of documentation, Durst said. Even if it were two years, thats not necessarily an indication that they have gone away, Durst said. When asked if they were able to trace the attacks back to China, Croom reiterated the companys policy of non-attribution.

The threat actor group, dubbed APT1 by FireEye-owned Mandiant, is alleged to be one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors, which the security firm claims has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations. Since the Mandiant report came out, we saw an immediate decrease in attacks, Charles Charlie Croom, VP of Cyber Strategy and Government Relations at Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions, told SecurityWeek. While Mandiants report was met with criticism by some, particularly around the challenges of attribution, its clear that the report had a significant impact and triggered a reaction from the alleged state sponsored threat actors. Were glad Mandiant stood up, Croom said. The good news is that they are not attacking Lockheed Martin any more because we are too hard, so they are going to our suppliers, he said. They will go to a supplier who has the connection to Lockheed Martin from an IT perspective, or even in a sharing of documentation, Durst said.

Mandiant believes APT1 is the 2nd Bureau of the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) General staff Departments (GSD) 3rd Department, commonly known by its Military unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398. Mandiant said that it was able to confirm 937 command and control servers running on 849 distinct IP addresses and has confirmed 2,551 domain names attributed to APT1 in the last several years. Mandiant highlighted an attack in 2008 that compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. In late January, The New York Times said hackers stole corporate passwords and targeted the computers of 53 employees including former Beijing bureau chief Jim Yardley, who is now the South Asia bureau chief at the Times based in India, after the newspaper published a report on the vast wealth amassed by Premier Wen Jiabao's family. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us, Mandiant noted.

"APT1 is still active using a well-coordinated and well-defined attack methodology against a wide set of industries -- with a discernible post-report shift towards new tools and infrastructure," wrote Dan Mcwhorter, Mandiant's managing director for threat intelligence. The report was the first time a private sector company had laid out evidence to link the China to cyber-espionage campaigns against businesses and government entities around the world. "APT1 has stopped using the vast majority of the infrastructure that was disclosed with the release of the indicators," Mcwhorter wrote. The group has not been knocked out yet, as it probably still has access to an extensive infrastructure of computers around the world. Mandiant noted that APT1 is only one of more than 20 Advanced Persistent Threat groups operating out of China that the company is aware of.

According to FireEye, the victims in this attack were hand picked, with the opening stage of the attack itself coming via email. After that, a base64-encoded executable embedded in an HTML page is downloaded and ran on the host. In our experiment, since the CnC was not responding, we supplied an encoded notepad.exe in the response. We have observed many variants of this malware; some even try sending hostname and IP address information back to its CnC as part of its User-Agent string in the GET request. One of the variants we observed had IPhone 8.5 in the UA string, which we found interesting.
Its worth mentioning that FireEyes findings included a list of malware that was previously disclosed by Mandiant in their APT1 report.

Experts reported that early Operation Dust Storm attacks were relatively unsophisticated and they were easily detected by the security industry. The following year, they leveraged another Internet Explorer zero-day (CVE-2012-1889) in their operations. In March 2013, shortly after Mandiant published a report on the notorious Chinese state-sponsored threat group known as APT1, experts noticed a significant drop in Operation Dust Storm activity until August 2013. In addition to its previous tools, in May 2015, the group added several Android backdoors to its arsenal.

The most notable of these campaigns is the VOHO attack campaign of June, 2012.

Hidden Lynx  Professional Hackers for Hire For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesnt just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information.

What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9s trusted file signing infrastructure. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing infrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this system to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to compromise the true intended targets.
