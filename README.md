## Information Extraction, information retrieval from Cybersecurity report websites

Data: The cyber security companies’ security incident reports

Extract information of attacker’s name, tools, ip addresses and so on Challenge:
1. Attacker’s name is named by each company and does not match 
2. The detail of the report is very different from the company.
3. Design and save the collected information to the specific format.

Each cyber security company or lab publish Security Incident Reports. Each company names a hacker group by its rule.
We want to collect and extract each report to merge same group’s tools that they use, targets, their methods and so on.
